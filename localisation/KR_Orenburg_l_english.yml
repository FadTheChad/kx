### Events ###
orenburg.1.t: "The Orenburg Cossack Host"
orenburg.1.d: "The second oldest after the Don Cossack Host, the Orenburg Cossacks have been in loyal service to the Russian Motherland since 1748, defending, like their neighboring Ural Cossacks, the country's border from Kazakh nomads. By 1917, the Orenburg Host was among the most battle-ready units. However, the difficult years of the Weltkrieg and the Revolution affected all Cossack units, and the Orenburg unit was no exception.\n\nThe very next day after the Bolshevik takeover in Petrograd, Aleksandr Dutov, the Ataman of the Orenburg Host, announced his non-recognition of Soviet authority and assumed full executive power within the Host. Martial law was declared in Orenburg. Public gatherings and demonstrations were prohibited, the Bolshevik town hall was dispersed and publication of the 'Proletarian' Bolshevik newspaper was banned. Post offices and telegraph offices were occupied by Junker patrols. This state of affairs did not last for long. By the end of January 1918, the Bolsheviks captured Orenburg, and Dutov and his faithful Cossacks withdrew to Verkhneuralsk. In March 1918 Verkhneuralsk also fell to the Bolsheviks and Dutov retreated to the Turgay Steppes.\n\nMeanwhile, widespread looting and terror by the Bolsheviks led to the majority of Orenburg Cossacks turning against them. Self-defense detachments spontaneously began to arise in villages. The Cossacks ambushed and disrupted detachments of Red punitive forces, seizing their weapons. Soon, the entire region was engulfed in an anti-Bolshevik uprising. Delegates were sent to Dutov to propose his return and leadership of the Host. The rebels lacked experienced commanders, as their detachments were led by junior officers unfamiliar to the general Cossack mass. Dutov, in addition to being popular, had an academic background, and his personality was able to unite all anti-Soviet forces."
orenburg.1.a: "What next?"

orenburg.2.t: "The Orenburg Cossack Host"
orenburg.2.d: "By this time, the strategic situation on the anti-Soviet front had undergone significant changes. The Czechoslovak Legion rebelled against the Bolshevik regime. Two anti-Bolshevik governments: the Komuch in Samara and the Siberian Provisional Government in Omsk, emerged. Ataman Dutov had to maneuver between these two entities, initially recognizing Komuch and then Omsk. As a result, he established an autonomous region for the Orenburg Host in the territory under its control, modeled after the Almighty Don Host, but with its own unique characteristics.\n\nDutov was characterized by a rare level of \"religious tolerance\" – all supporters of the fight against Bolshevism, ranging from monarchists to Mensheviks, were welcomed by him. At the same time, the leader dealt mercilessly with all those who dared sabotage the anti-Bolshevik campaign in the area under his supervision. Despite his democratic approach, Dutov recognized that the leader's authority must be firm and their actions decisive. After the coup of Kolchak, Dutov was the first to fully acknowledge the authority of the supreme leader. As a democratically minded leader, he argued to the Admiral, that after the defeat of the Bolshevik forces, the future of Russia should be decided by a free and fair multiparty elections. In September 1918, the city of Orsk, which had been the last remaining city under Bolshevik control in the region, was captured by Dutov's forces."
orenburg.2.a: "Interesting"

orenburg.3.t: "The Orenburg Cossacks in 1936"
orenburg.3.d: "After the capture of Orsk, the situation developed favorably for the White forces. By the end of 1919, virtually all of Russia came under their control and the remnants of the Bolshevik forces were soon defeated. A second Constituent Assembly was held, although its outcomes were disappointing for right-wing.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Civil War, the Orenburg Host was effectively split. The western portion, centered on Orenburg, became part of the Alash Autonomy, while the northeastern portion remained within Russia, forming the Chelyabinsk Governorate.\n\nThe prioritization of the interests of the Kazakh people and their democratic leaders by the new SR-Kadet government was deemed more significant than the interests of social groups such as the Cossacks. Although Dutov formally remained the Ataman of both portions of the Host separated by administrative boundaries, he was unwilling to fully submit to the authority of the Alash, albeit to a lesser extent than the Ataman of the Ural Cossacks, Vladimir Tolstov, was.\n\nThe situation has now deteriorated as the Alash Autonomy has begun to independently manage its internal affairs. Given their strong interest in controlling Orenburg, which is one of the key nodes of the Orenburg-Tashkent railway, and their clear indications that 'Orynbor' is a Kazakh territory, the ataman has his own plans for both the arrangement of the territory under his control and for Russia as a whole."
orenburg.3.a: "And thats brings us here."

orenburg.4.t: "Opposition Within the Circle"
orenburg.4.d: "The supreme body of the Orenburg Cossack Host is the Cossack Circle, which is the general military council of the Cossacks and the highest body of self-government. The circle has unlimited competence in solving local issues, covering matters of a military, economic, administrative, socio-political, legal, social and domestic nature. Despite the influence of Dutov and veterans of the Turgai March, due to the general democratic sentiment among the Orenburg Cossacks, his power is not as restricted as desired.\n\nTimofey Sedelnikov, an elected member of the Cossack Circle, who leads the \"left-wing\" faction within the Circle, stands out as a prominent figure in opposition to Dutov. He is one of the founding members of the \"independent, non-partisan newspaper for the free Cossacks\", and has been instrumental in drafting regulations for self-governance within the Orenburg Cossack Host. Additionally, he is the creator of the Cossack Democratic Party. Despite having published a number of sharp anti-Bolshevik conciliationist articles during the war, such as \"Left Tsarism\", \"The Coming Collapse of Bolshevism\", \"Inevitability of Reaction in Russia: Its Causes and Consequences\" and \"Blind Leaders\", he was simultaneously arrested by Bolshevik forces and expelled from Cossack ranks by Dutov supporters.\n\nAt the insistence of the Menshevik Party and the Russian government, Sedelnikov was nonetheless restored to the Cossack ranks. He opposes the transformation of the Cossacks into a closed military caste, which is an issue that has caused some concern for Ataman Dutov. However, due to his support from the Orenburg insurgents, who liberated the Orenburg region during the civil war, his interests must be taken into account."
orenburg.4.a: "A thorn in side of Dutov!"

orenburg.5.t: "A Matter of Utmost Importance"
orenburg.5.d: "In light of recent events, the issue of utmost importance is the attitude of the Orenburg Cossack Host towards the outbreak of Civil War in Russia. This is an event that cannot be disregarded by loyal patriots of our homeland. Unlike in the past, when children turned on their parents and brothers turned on each other, the defeat of the patriotic White forces is now a much more likely outcome. Ataman Dutov, in a speech dedicated to preventing another Bolshevik atrocity, called for an immediate armed struggle against those who had seized power in Moscow and Petrograd.\n\nAccording to his plan, the initial step was to contact the government of General [RVA.GetLeader] in [RVA.Capital.GetName], acknowledge his authority, and form an alliance with [RVA.GetNameDef]. Left-wing elements within the Cossack community immediately objected and opposed these swift decisions. A minority of delegates also expressed the view that it was premature to engage in open conflict with the Soviets at this time, but it is necessarty to support General [RVA.GetLeader]'s cause."
orenburg.5.a: "Immediately join the war on the side of [RVA.GetName]!"
orenburg.5.b: "Support [RVA.GetLeader], but take a break to prepare for war."
orenburg.5.c: "The Left convinced the majority of the Circle to abstain... for now."

orenburg.6.t: "The Reunion of the Host"
orenburg.6.d: "At present, some parts of the Host are under Bolshevik control, and although local villages and towns such as Troitsk and Verkhneuralsk have supported the leader, we do not fully control this territory. In accordance with the orders of the ataman, several Cossack units have been immediately dispatched to occupy these areas and re-establish the Orenburg Host as a single administrative unit."
