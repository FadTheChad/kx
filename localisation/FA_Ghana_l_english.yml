POLITICS_KWAME_NKRUMAH_DESC:0"Few Socialists in Africa are as prominent and respected as Kwame Nkrumah. Born in the small, rural village of Nkroful in 1909 into an impoverished family, Nkrumah lived a peaceful childhood, being raised in the traditional Akan culture as a Christian by his mother and large extended family. Nkrumah was educated at a Catholic mission in Half Assini as a boy, proving to be a sharp and dedicated pupil. Taken in by the German priest George Fischer, Nkrumah would be molded into a fiercely intelligent young man, becoming a student-teacher and graduating from his elementary studies two years early. His genius, not to be ignored, was noticed by the deen of the Achimota School, one Reverend Alec Garden Fraser, who soon took notice to the young intellectual, whisking Nkrumah away from the rural backwaters of rural Ghana and sending him to the capital of Accra to further his studies in the finest university in the colony. \n\nWhile at this hallowed academic institution, Kwame Nkrumah struck up a close friendship with the deputy headmaster Kwegyir Aggrey, a noted missionary and intellectual known for dabbling in Pan-African ideals. It was here, under Aggrey’s tutelage, that Nkrumah would be exposed to the writings of W.E.B Du Bois, George Padmore, and Marcus Garvey, among many others, setting him on the path of Pan-Africanism. Still holding a great interest in religion however, the conflicted Nkrumah still occasionally dreamt of becoming a Jesuit missionary, but fate had other ideas, as after one brush-in with Nigerian national father Nnamdi Azikiwe, titan of the Pan-African scene, Nkrumah’s worldview would never be the same. Witnessing this larger-than-life politician give an impassioned speech on the righteousness of Black nationalism shortly before his own graduation, Nkrumah’s inner conflict was instantly resolved. Faith would always be important to him, but Nkrumah knew at that moment that his true calling was something greater. \n\nWith these new ideals in mind, Nkrumah left for the United States, spending much of the early 1930’s attending different Black universities in the United States while developing his own strain of Pan-African Socialism. With the cracks in Mittelafrika’s foundations becoming ever more apparent, Kwame Nkrumah returned home to the Gold Coast earlier than planned, emboldened by the new ideals he picked up from his time abroad, and embedded himself immediately within the political scene of Ghana. Preaching for egalitarianism, educational reform, and, above all, Pan-African Socialist Democracy, Nkrumah and his platform have become explosively popular across the nation, earning him the position as Ghana’s first President. Now, only time will tell if Nkrumah will stay true to his preached noble ideals, or if he will take more direct action to ensure that the Pan-African dream is realized."

The makeup of his government is yet to be decided; will the CPP continue down the moderate socialist course, or will Nkrumah take influence from the Internationale and other Syndicalist systems. Nkrumah could also embrace Totalist and Authoritarian Syndicalist Systems, making Ghana into a one-party state. This radical course however could draw Nkrumah’s detractors out of the woodworks.."
