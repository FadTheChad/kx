### Leader Bios ###

POLITICS_PEDRO_VII_DESC:0 "The current Manikongo, Pedro VII do Congo, has reigned since 1923 as king of the Benikongo, though only recently has he physically taken a seat on his rightful throne. Forced into exile due to the German seizure of his homeland, this true African king has lived abroad in São Salvador in Angola, awaiting for his moment to reclaim his rightful throne, and Mittelfafrika’s collapse has provided just such a moment. Heavily supported and financed by Portugal and receiving direct aid from the Iberians through Angola, the Manikongo’s forces are surprisingly well armed for tribal rabble. Under their king, these fierce and savage waves of native troops wage war to conquer the former lands of the Kingdom of Kongo, claiming the kingdom owed to him by birthright as the most direct living heir to the last sovereign Manikongo."

### Ideas ###
KOG_reliance_on_portugal_idea:0 "Reliance on Portugal"
KOG_reliance_on_portugal_idea_desc:0 "For many decades, the Manikongo and the Portuguese have cooperated, bringing Christianity and Western customs to our Kongo. In exchange for allowing them to extract our land’s resources and to use our people for labor, we have gained their protection and their aid. However, the current Manikongo has long chafed under this uneven deal, slowly losing patience with his colonial ‘allies’, and many feel as though this partnership is not fated to last."
KOG_claims_of_greatness_idea:0 "Claims of Greatness"
KOG_claims_of_greatness_idea_desc:0 "We are the heirs of the Kongo Kingdom, and the one, true, and rightful lords of the vast Congo. However, most do not recognize this claim, especially given our weakened state, both unconnected from the heartland of our territory in northern Angola and separated from our kin in Bas-Congo.

### Focuses ###

### Revolt Tree ###

KOG_manikongo_proclaimation:0 "The Manikongo's Proclamation"
KOG_manikongo_proclaimation_desc:0 "Exiled by the German forces, Pedro VII, the Manikongo, had spent the duration of his reign living in São Salvador. The Manikongo was  able to amend the Kingdom’s relationship with Lisbon, receiving funding and support to help destabilize Mittelafrika. With the fall of the colonial order, Pedro VII returned to his homeland, proclaiming himself the rightful king of the Bakongo, but these celebrations were cut short. The Manikongo finds his people besieged on all sides, the maniacal Leon M’ba seeks to return French rule to the Congo and the Anziku have launched an invasion to seize the local capital of Brazzaville. The Manikongo must effectively lead his people through the storm if he is to restore glory to his kingdom."
KOG_raid_german_armories:0 "Raid German Armories"
KOG_raid_german_armories_desc:0 "With the German order in Äquatorialafrika retreating to their colonial holdout in Kamerun, their hasty departure had left behind only the remains of their rule. Barracks that once swelled with the ranks of the Askari had been left to the vultures. Securing these abandoned stockpiles of weapons and ammunition will be invaluable in our fight for survival."
KOG_against_false_despots:0 "Against False Despots"
KOG_against_false_despots_desc:0 "Along the coast in Gabon, the corrupt Leon M’ba seeks to expand his kleptocracy at the expense of his own people. In the northeast, the ‘republicans’ of the Tshuapa Clique are led from the shadows by the demented she-witch Ngalifourou. Known to all as the ‘woman of the whites’, the Anziku queen wages war only to sell her own people. These tyrants have waged war against the Bakongo only to appease their French masters and return the Middle Congo to their rule."
KOG_question_lisbon:0 "Our Relationship with Lisbon"
KOG_question_lisbon_desc:0 "While the Manikongo has remained loyal to Lisbon, his recent arrival in Kongo has raised doubts about any continued ‘cooperation’. While a strong European ally would be beneficial towards retaining our independence, the scars left during the revolt of 1914 are still prevalent among the Bakongo, who are distrustful of the Portuguese. The shadow of Portugal looms over the Kingdom, and Pedro must decide whether to continue our close relationship with Lisbon or set forth a new path for the Kingdom."
KOG_request_portuguese_arms:0 "Request Portuguese Arms"
KOG_request_portuguese_arms_desc:0 "While we have made do with the arms from our initial expedition and the rifles we obtained from the German stockpiles, we find ourselves outgunned by our enemies who have received a steady flow of weapons from their French backers in Algiers. We will ask our allies in Lisbon to provide us with modern rifles to replace our German antiques and turn the tide of battle."
KOG_angolan_cacadores:0 "Call Upon the Caçadores"
KOG_angolan_cacadores_desc:0 "The Caçadores, or hunters, are among the elite of the Portuguese armed forces. Famed for their expert sharpshooting, these light regiments were recently reformed to protect Portuguese colonies against foreign raids and have helped retain order in the Ultramar. With the war against the maniacal M’ba and the Anziku still raging, we shall ask the colonial government in Luanda to provide us with an elite regiment to aid us in our struggle."
KOG_rally_the_homeland:0 "Rally the Homeland"
KOG_rally_the_homeland_desc:0 "In our battle against the tyrants who would hope to crush our people, we have suffered heavy casualties that are proving difficult to replace. To help fill our ranks, we shall use these figures to call upon our Bakongo kin who reside around the Congo Basin to join us in our fight for survival. We will call upon Bakongo elders to provide us with much needed reinforcements and appeal to those who are in the service of the remnant Force Publique to defect and join us in our crusade to save their own people rather than the profits of their colonial overlords."
KOG_assert_independence:0 "Assert our Independence"
KOG_assert_independence_desc:0 "A deviation from his previous stance towards cooperation with the Portuguese, the Manikongo has taken an assertive stance. Leaning into the Bakongo nationalists and tribal leaders, the Manikongo has begun to revoke previous treaties made with the Portuguese, ending his vassalage to Lisbon and ruling as a true sovereign monarch. While the colonial office in Luanda is outraged by the Manikongo’s betrayal, his new subjects have begun to rally behind their King."
KOG_manikongo_authority:0 "The Authority of the Manikongo"
KOG_manikongo_authority_desc:0 "No nation holds a greater claim to the lands along this basin apart from the Kingdom of Kongo. As opposed to these kleptocrats and pretenders who have waged war against us, the Manikongo, Pedro VII, descends from a line of dutiful elected chiefs from a Kingdom whose influence can be traced back nearly five hundred years. Our Kingdom made dealings with the great powers of Europe and the Papacy and dominated trade within the Congo Basin. With the fall of the colonial order in Africa, we shall rise once again to dominate these lands under the rule of the Manikongo."
KOG_push_against_teke:0 "Assault Against the Anziku"
KOG_push_against_teke_desc:0 "The people living under the ‘Tshuapa Clique’ are hopelessly led by a disorganized cabal locked in a power struggle. Torn between republican demagogues, socialists, and the shaman queen of the Anziku, this unstable polity only exists to return the whole of the Middle Congo to French oppression. To bring an end to this chaos, we shall lead a final and decisive campaign along the Congo River. The Anziku had once been vassals of our Kingdom, it’s time we remind them of that fact. "
KOG_peace_with_the_madman:0 "Peace with the Madman?"
KOG_peace_with_the_madman_desc:0 "While our warriors have fought bravely against the Gabonese, there appears to be no end in sight to this conflict as the frontlines grind to an utter halt. Being sparsely populated with our Bakongo kin, military occupation could greatly destabilize our kingdom and potentially incite another revolt. By utilizing Portugal’s connections to the powers of the Entente, we shall work to broker peace between our Kingdom and the Republic of Gabon."

### Political Tree ###

KOG_between_two_worlds:0 "A Kingdom Between Two Worlds"
KOG_between_two_worlds_desc:0 "As the fires of war fade over the lands that we now govern, it seems that the Manikongo has finally found peace in the chaos of Mittelafrika’s collapse. And yet, there remain forces that lurk in the shadows, from the Portuguese who hungrily eye our domain, to the remnant dissidents of the North who remain resolute in their opposition. Even within the Royal Court, there remains a divide between those who want to return to Portugal’s embrace, and those who want to tear down the legacy of Portuguese dominance, for a true nation free from colonialism no matter what. As these shadows circle around us, the final decision lies with our King Pedro, for he shall decide where our newly independent kingdom will stand. Will we return under Lisbon’s gaze once more, or do we refuse the former colonials, for a true Kingdom for the Manikongo free from colonialist vultures?"
KOG_portuguese_patronage:0 "Continued Portuguese Patronage"
KOG_portuguese_patronage_desc:0 "The King has made his decision, that our Kingdom shall continue its cooperation with Portugal, citing our long and storied history under Lisbon’s protection, and how its legacy still influences our people and kingdom today. As such, they have proven themselves to be a reliable partner with the Manikongo, and our Kingdom shall reach out to Lisbon and reconnect former ties with our former benefactors, in exchange for their patronage and assistance in building our nation."
KOG_integralist_influences:0 "Luso-Integralist Influences"
KOG_integralist_influences_desc:0 "In the past decades, the Catholic political currents of Europe have been greatly affected by the ideals of integralism pioneered by Charles Maurras and his Action Française. The ideals of integral nationalism calls for an organic, decentralized state that greatly empowers both the church and the monarchy. In Portugal, the rise of Integralismo Lusitano in the 20’s had permeated throughout the empire, making it no surprise that such ideas have arrived within the Manikongo’s court as well. Seeking to draw closer to our Portuguese allies, Pedro VII has begun reforming the kingdom along integralist philosophies, whose ideals of highly decentralized provinces are not dissimilar to how our kingdom has already operated for centuries."
KOG_legacy_of_afonso:0 "Legacy of Dom Alfonso"
KOG_legacy_of_afonso_desc:0 "Afonso I, the sixth Manikongo and the son of João I was truly one of the first devout Catholic converts who helped spread Catholicism across the kingdom and fostered close political ties to Portugal. While many including his father shied away from their new faiths shortly after the arrival of the Portuguese, Afonso was one of the few who remained constant to his newfound devotion - even proclaiming it as the sole reason he defeated his half-brother in a succession crisis after João’s death. Through collaboration with Portugal and our strong Catholic faith, our Kingdom has survived and flourished - we must continue in his legacy to gain further success."
KOG_portuguese_labor:0 "Provide Kongolese Labor"
KOG_portuguese_labor_desc:0 "Due to our close relationship with Portugal and our relative position to its ultramarine provinces, a plan has been proposed between both the Portuguese and Kongolese governments for a mutually beneficial plan to aid each of our developing economies in their colonial empire and within our beloved country. The people of the Kongo will be given opportunities for labor in both nearby Portuguese possessions such as Angola or Mozambique, and as far as Sao Tome. While some anti-colonial and nationalist voices argue that this is the equivalent of modern-day slavery and is binding the stability of the nation’s economy to that of Portugal’s, the benefits of an overseas working-class population sending home remittances to their families here in the Kongo will significantly aid our economy!"
KOG_church_of_kongo:0 "Catholic Church of the Kongo"
KOG_church_of_kongo_desc:0 "From the first arrival of Portuguese missionaries on our shores, the Kongo people were quick to embrace the Christian faith. Through the guidance of the pious Manikongo, Afonso I, the Catholic faith was intertwined within our kingdom, with the church serving an important role in civil service and education. Through our faith we found ourselves on equal footing with the great powers of Europe, bringing our Kingdom closer to Rome through pious princes being ordained as bishops and Kongo diplomats negotiating for the return of Kongo slaves. We shall greatly expand the powers of the clergy to serve as a guide for our kingdom during such turbulent times."
KOG_foreign_studies:0 "Send our Sons Abroad"
KOG_foreign_studies_desc:0 "The seeds of the modern Kingdom of Kongo were planted several centuries ago through the Portuguese abduction of natives and nobles with their arrival on our shores. While they may have been hostages, the education and experience gained through their role as indigenous ambassadors highlighted the importance of this collaboration between Europe and our Kingdom. The fifth Manikongo, João I, understood this and had sent many of his principal nobles and sons to study and learn under Portugal. We shall follow in their stead and send our sons abroad to educate a new generation!"
KOG_traditionalist_revival:0 "Traditionalist Revival"
KOG_traditionalist_revival_desc:0 "Our alignment with the Portuguese has cost us dearly in our political realm! Rumors have arisen of discontent nobles who dare plot against the Manikongo with potential German backing due to the fears of the Kingdom becoming nothing more than a puppet to Portugal. Seeking to squash these rumors, the Manikongo will firmly entrench the kingdom in its tribalist roots and disavow any strings to Lisbon to ensure our sovereignty."
KOG_bakongo_practices:0 "Promote Bakongo Practices"
KOG_bakongo_practices_desc:0 "While the Kongo Kingdom was quick to embrace Catholic teachings, these ideas were heavily infused with our native Bakongo faith. With the Manikongo’s recent push towards a tribalist stance, our government has sought to promote Bakongo traditions while still honoring our adherence to Christianity. Syncretic sects such as Antonianism and the more recent Kimbanguist church shall be embraced as an alternative to the foreign missionaries who have long held a stranglehold over both our kingdom and our faith."
KOG_tribalist_structures:0 "Embrace Tribalist Structures"
KOG_tribalist_structures_desc:0 "Heeding the words of Bakongo nationalists and local chiefs, the Manikongo has cast aside the European style of governance that is utterly incompatible with our people and has instead chosen to embrace our traditional style of government. Pedro’s court shall be organized around the twelve of his closest advisors that will help guide the Manikongo and his kingdom. The governors of local provinces will retain a high degree of autonomy over their respective regions. Our standing army and police forces will be assembled by local chiefs on their merit and bravery rather than the corrupt mercenary armies or conscripted forces of our rivals. Through these sweeping reforms we will return to our roots while cultivating a government that is tune with the needs of our people."
KOG_masters_of_the_basin:0 "Masters of the Congo Basin"
KOG_masters_of_the_basin_desc:0 "For centuries our strategic location at the mouth of the Congo Basin has allowed our kingdom to control the flow of trade between the European powers and the vast riches of the Congo. During this time we profited greatly from the trade of ivory, gold, copper, and slaves. With alternative overland routes being restricted by the chaos that has engulfed the entire continent, we will use our advantageous position to facilitate trade with the great powers of Europe as we had done before."
KOG_fate_of_monarchy:0 "Fate of the House of Água Rosada"
KOG_fate_of_monarchy_desc:0 "Unlike traditional monarchies, the title of Manikongo is not hereditary. A new Manikongo is instead chosen through an election by the king’s chief advisors. Pedro VII, our Manikongo, is head of the House of Água Rosada, a noble Kongo family who have ruled for the last two centuries. While we have honored our unique traditions, the Manikongo has grown concerned about the numerous pretenders to our throne, who might attempt to seize power and hand our kingdom back to the Portuguese or Germans."
KOG_native_universities:0 "Nativist Education Under our Faith"
KOG_native_universities_desc:0 "Before the arrival of the Portuguese, education was provided by a series of schools tied to the Bakongo faith. Derided as secret societies by the Portuguese, these elite schools were used for training the youth in the ways of civil service and medicine. While these schools such as Kimpasi, Kinkimba, Buelo, and Lemba were open to anyone, the rigorous initiation ceremonies reserved these schools to the brightest minds in the kingdom. With our kingdom’s revival of Bakongo culture, we will greatly increase our support funding for these native schools and lighten the initiation rites that are required to attend these schools."
KOG_deal_for_mbanza_kongo:0 "Negotiate for M'banza-Kongo"
KOG_deal_for_mbanza_kongo_desc:0 "Our cooperation with the Portuguese has borne great fruits for both nations. However, one problem still persists in regards to the regions that formerly belonged to the Bakongo. For centuries, under Portuguese patronage, our kingdom thrived in the regions that are now known as M'banza-Kongo and Cabinda, at least until its violent abolishment in 1915 by the Portuguese, driving us to these Northern regions. However, with our renewed and more equal relationship, perhaps a renegotiation with our benefactors for our ancestral capital is in order, returning the rightful rule of the Bakongo over these lands after so long."
KOG_claims_of_greatness:0 "Claims of Greatness"
KOG_claims_of_greatness_desc:0 "The region that is now known as Central Africa by the colonialists was once ruled by proud kings, only to lose to those damned colonialists, either through treachery or through the bayonet. But now, as the grip of colonialism loosens and the carcass of Mittelafrika continues to burn, we stand as a bastion of order and tradition in Africa, free from colonialism and false notions of ‘progress’ from the Western-educated intellectuals and colonialist stooges. With our independence solidified, our Kingdom looks outwards, into the chaos around us. In the steps of great empires of Africa, with the leadership of our dear King of the Manikongo, we shall assert our independence by bringing our rule over the regions of the Congo Basin and Angola, bringing the weary peoples under our wise governance. The ambitions of the Bakongo shall not be hindered, neither by power hungry colonialists, traitorous republicans and whatever elements that oppose us."
KOG_our_lost_brethren:0 "Recover our Lost Brethren"
KOG_our_lost_brethren_desc:0 "While our kingdom initially held a monopoly over the slave trade, war and internal conflicts saw the Manikongo’s protection over his subjects weaken as European traders began to circumvent our laws and sold free Kongo men and women as slaves. During this period, our Kingdom’s influence waned as millions of people from the Congo Basin were captured and sold in the Americas. An ocean away from their homeland, these slaves brought their culture to the New World and some escaped slaves had created their own communities. Known in Brazil as Quilombos or ‘war camps’, these escaped slaves lived in the hinterlands and often relied on raids against colonial settlements to survive. The largest of these communities was the Quilombo dos Palmares, led by Nganga Nzumba, the son of a Kongo princess. With the Manikongo’s realm secured, we shall undertake a near herculean task, the unification of the Kongo’s lost sons and daughters in the Americas."
KOG_afro_bolivian_ties:0 "Afro-Bolivian Ties"
KOG_afro_bolivian_ties_desc:0 "The remote village of Mururata in Bolivia is both the center of the Afro-Bolivian community and home of its very own king, Don Bonifacio Pinedo. Their first king, Uchicho, was a Kongo prince who was believed to be the son of the Manikongo. Identified by the royal markings on his skin, Uchicho was crowned by the slaves as their king and their royal family has served as ceremonial rulers for the Afro-Bolivians for over a century, overseeing important religious ceremonies as well as resolving marital affairs within the community. Seeking to expand our royal house, we shall expand our rule into the mountains of Bolivia to both empower our kin and establish a cadet branch with the distant House of Pinedo."
KOG_mouth_of_the_congo:0 "Seize the Mouth of the Congo"
KOG_mouth_of_the_congo_desc:0 "To the south of our kingdom lies the city of Leopoldville. Known as the crown jewel of the Congo, this colonial capital has largely stayed out of the conflict, watching from the sidelines as they control the flow of information and trade to the rest of the Congo. To control this crucial trade route and reunite with our Bakongo brethren in Bas-Congo and Northern Angola, the Manikongo has laid preparations for a campaign to liberate Leopoldville and seize this crown jewel for ourselves."

### Kasa-Vubu ###

KOG_kasavubus_redoubt:0 "Kasa-Vubu's Redoubt"
KOG_kasavubus_redoubt_desc:0 "The collapse of the Kivu Clique had led to its former revolutionaries fleeing abroad to escape imprisonment by the new regime that had seized the Congo. One such exile is Joseph Kasa-Vubu, who has led the remnants of the ABAKO to seek refuge in the Kongo Kingdom. With his back against the wall, the politically savvy Kasa-Vubu was able to quickly outmaneuver the archaic tribal structures within the kingdom, rising to become the chief minister to the Manikongo himself. A committed modernizer and Bakongo nationalist, Kasa-Vubu seeks to reform the antiquated Kongo Kingdom into a prosperous, modern nation that serves the needs of his people."
KOG_embrace_nationalist_faiths:0 "Embrace Nzambi a Mpungu's Light"
KOG_embrace_nationalist_faiths_desc:0 "The Kongo Kingdom is well known for its quick embrace of Christianity under the rule of Afonso I. While Catholicism has become ingrained within the region for centuries, foreign missionaries have allowed Portugal to keep the kingdom under their thumb. Seeking to drift away from these lingering European influences, the ABAKO leadership has fully embraced the syncretic faiths that have flowed through the Congo tributary. In addition to promoting the Bakongo faith that is native to our people, Kasa-Vubu has fostered ties with the emerging Kimbanguist church that has spread rapidly throughout Leopoldville and the greater Bas-Congo."
KOG_capitalist_reforms:0 "Institute Capitalist Reforms"
KOG_capitalist_reforms_desc:0 "While ABAKO was founded to further the interests of the Bakongo people, we were able to enjoy a wider array of support among the Congolese people through our promotion of moderate capitalist reforms and infrastructure initiatives. Both rural and urban populations would benefit greatly through our reforms that would bring electrification and clean water to remote villages and a complete renovation of our largest cities. While we were never able to implement these reforms, our consolidation of power in the Kongo Kingdom will provide us with a clean slate to introduce these reforms to our Bakongo people."
KOG_enshrine_bakongo_nationalism:0 "Enshrine Bakongo Nationalism"
KOG_enshrine_bakongo_nationalism_desc:0 "It has long been Joseph Kasa-Vubu’s goal to promote and further the aims of his native Bakongo people. His unwavering stance towards supporting the Bakongo and admiration for the Kongo Kingdom had put him at odds with other Kivu revolutionaries and even ABAKO’s founder, Edmond Nzeza-Nlandu. With Kasa-Vubu’s ascension within the Manikongo’s court, he has found himself free to pursue policies that solely benefit the Bakongo people. No longer having to appease the hundreds of ethnic groups that inhabit the vast Congo basin, Kasa-Vubu and ABAKO have worked tirelessly to promote a nationalistic, pro-Bakongo identity in all aspects of society."
KOG_crush_portuguese_influence:0 "Crush Portuguese Influence"
KOG_crush_portuguese_influence_desc:0 "For centuries, the noble Kongo Kingdom found itself at odds with their so-called Portuguese ‘allies’. While the misguided kings of the past extended their hands in friendship to Lisbon, they were met with civil strife, broken alliances, and the sale of millions of slaves that brought the once proud kingdom to its knees. While the Manikongo and his men fought tooth and nail to restore his rightful kingdom in the fires of Mittelafrika’s collapse, the colonial office in Luanda sat idly by, waiting to hand over their stipulations of continued vassalage. With Kasa-Vubu’s rule secured, we shall drive out the remaining Portuguese sympathizers and nationalize the parasitic companies that have exploited our people for centuries."
KOG_abako_constitutionalism:0 "Constitutionalism Under the ABAKO"
KOG_abako_constitutionalism_desc:0 "Entrenching itself over the archaic structures of the Manikongo’s court, ABAKO has quickly engulfed the tribal government and has paved the way for a modern government. Through our reforms, Kasa-Vubu has reshaped the centuries old Kongo Kingdom into a constitutional monarchy that is fit to serve the needs of the Bakongo people. A new constitution has been drafted that protects our Bakongo people, faith, and culture under the watchful eye of ABAKO. While some decry ABAKO cementing its power into a ‘one party state’, the nascent political scene in the Manikongo’s domain has made our alliance the only formal political party in the region, and we intend to keep it that way."

kog.9.t:0 "The Question of our ‘Partnership’"
kog.9.d:0 "The drums of war often do not steadily beat - we find ourselves overextending ourselves in both supplies and manpower while our enemies continue to see success after success on a daily basis. We are unfortunately left with two options: to procure war material and manpower through harsher measures within the Kingdom or sacrifice our sovereignty to Lisbon in exchange for much-needed, crucial support."

kog.10.d:0 "the manikongo must now decide the fate of the monarchy, retain the current government (pataut tribalism), establish an absolute hereditary monarchy under the house of agua rosada, embrace our unique non-hereditary structure (elective monarchy), or lean into supporting local chiefs and councilors (authdem tribalism)"

kog.11.b:0 "The old man still has use for us"

kog.12.t:0 "The Distinction of Kongolese Catholicism"
kog.12.d:0 "native faith flavor event, mention Antonianism and Beatriz Kimpa Vita as its founder and its links to Kimbanguism as well as our support of Kimbanguism, helps have our own strain of the Catholic faith distant from Eurocentric Roman Catholicism, mention how Catholicism likens the native Kongo faith’s gods and spirits to Catholicism’s God and angels, we still Christian/Catholic but not Euro dominated, pursues a dual platform of supporting Kimbanguism/Kongolese Catholicism as well as native Kongo faith, can also mention João I the first voluntarily Catholic manikongo in Kongo history"

kog.13.t:0 "The Revival of the Order of Christ"
kog.13.d:0 "Though the Imperial Order of Our Lord Jesus Christ, or the Kongolese Kingdoms own Catholic knightly order, has existed in some form or another since 1607 when the Portuguese first brought the Order of Christ to our shores, it has largely decayed over the centuries, especially after its power and influence were severely truncated in 1914, when Portugal shifted it from a National Order, holding sway over the entire Kongolese Kingdom, to a largely powerless arm of the defanged monarchy as a House Order following the failed Kongo Revolt of 1914 and its aftermath in 1915 onwards which saw the Manikongo himself largely reduced to a powerless and puppeted facade in service to the colonial regime. Blah blah blah we revive the Order and have Knights again… can also mention João I the first voluntarily Catholic manikongo in Kongo history and name the revived order after him, and mention Sobas their special knight rank"

kog.14.d:0 "long ago a prince of Kongo named Henrique, son of Afonso I, became a Catholic bishop and was granted the title of the bishopric of utica by the pope. Should we reclaim his post and conquer Tunis?"

kog.15.t:0 "Cultural Ties to the New World"
kog.15.d:0 "in Brazil (Palomares) and Bolivia (Mururata), there are diasporic communities of Kongo people that established their own kingdoms modeled on our own Manikongo while also taking Portuguese and Spanish influences, while in Brazil (Candomble Bantu), Cuba (Palo), and Jamaica (Kumina) each have their own syncretic faiths that fuse Kongo religious teachings with various native and Christian ideas depending on the location, and Brazil’s own Engolo and Capoeira fighting styles both have Kongo-Bantu roots, showing that even across time and space, we Kongolese are and always will be connected."

kog.16.t:0 "Kongo Wishes to Join our Faction"
kog.16.d:0 "We have received a delegation from the Kingdom of Kongo requesting to join our alliance. The Manikongo's kingdom has recently engaged in a war to reclaim the lands of the former Belgian Congo. With their victory, the vast natural resources of the Congo now lie in the domain of the Manikongo and their inclusion into our faction could greatly expand our influence in Africa. What should we do?"
kog.16.a:0 "They are welcome!"
kog.16.b:0 "We don't need them."

kog.17.t:0 "Negotiations Fail"

kog.18.t:0 "A Pink Map of our Own?"
kog.18.d:0 "Decades of Portuguese colonial ambitions and influence have somehow managed to seep into equally ambitious minds within the upper echelons of our government. Given the circumstances that we no longer find ourselves burdened by any devotion to Lisbon - there is no reason why we shouldn’t ease the burdens of the ailing Portuguese colonial empire through the “transfer” of Mozambique, Angola, and any connecting territories."
kog.18.a:0 "We will paint the map as we please!"
kog.18.b:0 "It’s too much of a risk to take..."

kog.19.t:0 "A New Banner for our Realm?"
kog.19.d:0 "With Pedro's triumph over the Congolese pretenders, we must now choose which flag we shall fly in the Manikongo’s new realm. Some have proposed that we should use Pedro VII’s coat of arms, first issued to Afonso I by the Portuguese, as our national banner. More traditionalist chiefs have suggested that we use the flag that was designed by Franciscan monks for Garcia II, a fiercely independent king who opposed the Portuguese in Angola. Some reformist thinkers have advocated that we modernize our current flag with a saltire that includes the coat of arms in the middle. Some however, don't see a need for change and we should continue to use the flag that has been in use for centuries."
kog.19.a:0 "Use the Manikongo's Coat of Arms as our flag"
