### Leader Bios ###

POLITICS_PEDRO_VII_DESC:0 "The current Manikong, Pedro VII do Congo, has reigned since 1923 as king of the Benikongo, though only recently has he physically taken a seat on his rightful throne. Forced into exile due to the German’s control of his homeland, this true African king has lived abroad in São Salvador in Angola, awaiting for his moment to reclaim his rightful throne, and Mittelfafrika’s collapse has provided just such a moment.Heavily supported and financed by Portugal and receiving direct aid from the Iberians through Angola, the Manikongo’s forces are surprisingly well armed for tribal rabble. Under their king, these fierce and savage waves of native troops wage war to conquer the former lands of the Kingdom of Kongo, claiming the kingdom owed to him by birthright as the most direct living heir to the last sovereign Manikongo."

### Ideas ###
KOG_reliance_on_portugal_idea:0 "Reliance on Portugal"
KOG_reliance_on_portugal_idea_desc:0 "For many decades, the Manikongo and the Portuguese have cooperated, bringing Christianity and Western customs to our Kongo. In exchange for allowing them to extract our land’s resources and to use our people for labor, we have gained their protection and their aid. However, the current Manikongo has long chafed under this uneven deal, slowly losing patience with his colonial ‘allies’, and many feel as though this partnership is not fated to last."
KOG_claims_of_greatness_idea:0 "Claims of Greatness"
KOG_claims_of_greatness_idea_desc:0 "We are the heirs of the Kongo Kingdom, and the one, true, and rightful lords of the vast Congo. However, most do not recognize this claim, especially given our weakened state, both unconnected from the heartland of our territory in northern Angola and separated from our kin in Bas-Congo. We must reclaim this destiny, though we will likely be forced to work with the Portuguese in order to achieve it."

### Focuses ###

### Revolt Tree ###

KOG_manikongo_proclaimation:0 "The Manikongo's Proclamation"
KOG_manikongo_proclaimation_desc:0 "Exiled by the German forces, Pedro VII, the Manikongo, had spent the duration of his reign living in São Salvador. The Manikongo was  able to amend the Kingdom’s relationship with Lisbon, receiving funding and support to help destabilize Mittelafrika. With the fall of the colonial order, Pedro VII returned to his homeland, proclaiming himself the rightful king of the Bakongo, but these celebrations were cut short. The Manikongo finds his people besieged on all sides, the maniacal Leon M’ba seeks to return French rule to the Congo and the Anziku have launched an invasion to seize the local capital of Brazzaville. The Manikongo must effectively lead his people through the storm if he is to restore glory to his kingdom."
KOG_raid_german_armories:0 "Raid German Armories"
KOG_raid_german_armories_desc:0 "With the German order in Äquatorialafrika retreating to their colonial holdout in Kamerun, their hasty departure had left behind only the remains of their rule. Barracks that once swelled with the ranks of the Askari had been left to the vultures. Securing these abandoned stockpiles of weapons and ammunition will be invaluable in our fight for survival."
KOG_against_false_despots:0 "Against False Despots"
KOG_against_false_despots_desc:0 "Along the coast in Gabon, the corrupt Leon M’ba seeks to expand his kleptocracy at the expense of his own people. In the northeast, the ‘republicans’ of the Tshuapa Clique are led from the shadows by the demented she-witch Ngalifourou. Known to all as the ‘woman of the whites’, the Anziku queen wages war only to sell her own people. These tyrants have waged war against the Bakongo only to appease their French masters and return the Middle Congo to their rule."
KOG_question_lisbon:0 "Our Relationship with Lisbon"
KOG_question_lisbon_desc:0 "While the Manikongo has remained loyal to Lisbon, his recent arrival in Kongo has raised doubts about any continued ‘cooperation’. While a strong European ally would be beneficial towards retaining our independence, the scars left during the revolt of 1914 are still prevalent among the Bakongo, who are distrustful of the Portuguese. The shadow of Portugal looms over the Kingdom, and Pedro must decide whether to continue our close relationship with Lisbon or set forth a new path for the Kingdom."
KOG_request_portuguese_arms:0 "Request Portuguese Arms"
KOG_request_portuguese_arms_desc:0 "While we have made do with the arms from our initial expedition and the rifles we obtained from the German stockpiles, we find ourselves outgunned by our enemies who have received a steady flow of weapons from their French backers in Algiers. We will ask our allies in Lisbon to provide us with modern rifles to replace our German antiques and turn the tide of battle."
KOG_angolan_cacadores:0 "Call Upon the Caçadores"
KOG_angolan_cacadores_desc:0 "The Caçadores, or hunters, are among the elite of the Portuguese armed forces. Famed for their expert sharpshooting, these light regiments were recently reformed to protect Portuguese colonies against foreign raids and have helped retain order in the Ultramar. With the war against the maniacal M’ba and the Anziku still raging, we shall ask the colonial government in Luanda to provide us with an elite regiment to aid us in our struggle."
KOG_rally_the_homeland:0 "Rally the Homeland"
KOG_rally_the_homeland_desc:0 "In our battle against the tyrants who would hope to crush our people, we have suffered heavy casualties that are proving difficult to replace. To help fill our ranks, we shall use these figures to call upon our Bakongo kin who reside around the Congo Basin to join us in our fight for survival. We will call upon Bakongo elders to provide us with much needed reinforcements and appeal to those who are in the service of the remnant Force Publique to defect and join us in our crusade to save their own people rather than the profits of their colonial overlords."
KOG_assert_independence:0 "Assert our Independence"
KOG_assert_independence_desc:0 "A deviation from his previous stance towards cooperation with the Portuguese, the Manikongo has taken an assertive stance. Leaning into the Bakongo nationalists and tribal leaders, the Manikongo has begun to revoke previous treaties made with the Portuguese, ending his vassalage to Lisbon and ruling as a true sovereign monarch. While the colonial office in Luanda is outraged by the Manikongo’s betrayal, his new subjects have begun to rally behind their King."
KOG_manikongo_authority:0 "The Authority of the Manikongo"
KOG_manikongo_authority_desc:0 "No nation holds a greater claim to the lands along this basin apart from the Kingdom of Kongo. As opposed to these kleptocrats and pretenders who have waged war against us, the Manikongo, Pedro VII, descends from a line of dutiful elected chiefs from a Kingdom whose influence can be traced back nearly five hundred years. Our Kingdom made dealings with the great powers of Europe and the Papacy and dominated trade within the Congo Basin. With the fall of the colonial order in Africa, we shall rise once again to dominate these lands under the rule of the Manikongo."
KOG_push_against_teke:0 "Assault Against the Anziku"
KOG_push_against_teke_desc:0 "The people living under the ‘Tshuapa Clique’ are hopelessly led by a disorganized cabal locked in a power struggle. Torn between republican demagogues, socialists, and the shaman queen of the Anziku, this unstable polity only exists to return the whole of the Middle Congo to French oppression. To bring an end to this chaos, we shall lead a final and decisive campaign along the Congo River. The Anziku had once been vassals of our Kingdom, it’s time we remind them of that fact. "
KOG_peace_with_the_madman:0 "Peace with the Madman?"
KOG_peace_with_the_madman_desc:0 "While our warriors have fought bravely against the Gabonese, there appears to be no end in sight to this conflict as the frontlines grind to an utter halt. Being sparsely populated with our Bakongo kin, military occupation could greatly destabilize our kingdom and potentially incite another revolt. By utilizing Portugal’s connections to the powers of the Entente, we shall work to broker peace between our Kingdom and the Republic of Gabon."

### Political Tree ###

KOG_between_two_worlds:0 "A Kingdom Between Two Worlds"
KOG_between_two_worlds_desc:0 "As the fires of war fade over the lands that we now govern, it seems that the Manikongo has finally found peace in the chaos of Mittelafrika’s collapse. And yet, there remain forces that lurk in the shadows, from the Portuguese who hungrily eye our domain, to the remnant dissidents of the North who remain resolute in their opposition. Even within the Royal Court, there remains a divide between those who want to return to Portugal’s embrace, and those who want to tear down the legacy of Portuguese dominance, for a true nation free from colonialism no matter what. As these shadows circle around us, the final decision lies with our King Pedro, for he shall decide where our newly independent kingdom will stand. Will we return under Lisbon’s gaze once more, or do we refuse the former colonials, for a true Kingdom for the Manikongo free from colonialist vultures?"
KOG_portuguese_patronage:0 "Continued Portuguese Patronage"
KOG_portuguese_patronage_desc:0 "The King has made his decision, that our Kingdom shall continue its cooperation with Portugal, citing our long and storied history under Lisbon’s protection, and how its legacy still influences our people and kingdom today. As such, they have proven themselves to be a reliable partner with the Manikongo, and our Kingdom shall reach out to Lisbon and reconnect former ties with our former benefactors, in exchange for their patronage and assistance in building our nation."
KOG_integralist_influences:0 "Luso-Integralist Influences"
KOG_integralist_influences_desc:0 "pedro has decided to move away from a tribalist government towards embracing european style integralism. Decentralism and local provinces that kind of sounds like how the kongo kingdom was run"
KOG_legacy_of_afonso:0 "Legacy of Dom Alfonso"
KOG_legacy_of_afonso_desc:0 "Afonso I, the sixth Manikongo and the son of João I was truly one of the first devout Catholic converts who helped spread catholicism across the kingdom and fostered close political ties to Portugal. While many including his father shied away from their new faiths shortly after the arrival of the Portuguese, Afonso was one of the few who remained constant to his newfound devotion - even proclaiming it as the sole reason he defeated his half-brother in a succession crisis after João’s death. Through collaboration with Portugal and our strong Catholic faith, our Kingdom has survived and flourished - we must continue in his legacy to gain further success."
KOG_portuguese_labor:0 "Provide Kongolese Labor"
KOG_portuguese_labor_desc:0 "Due to our close relationship with Portugal and our relative position to its ultramarine provinces, a plan has been proposed between both the Portuguese and Kongolese governments for a mutually beneficial plan to aid each of our developing economies in their colonial empire and within our beloved country. The people of the Kongo will be given opportunities for labor in both nearby Portuguese possessions such as Angola or Mozambique, and as far as Sao Tome. While some anti-colonial and nationalist voices argue that this is the equivalent of modern-day slavery and is binding the stability of the nation’s economy to that of Portugal’s, the benefits of an overseas working-class population sending home their earnings to their families here in the Kongo will significantly aid our economy!"
KOG_church_of_kongo:0 "Catholic Church of the Kongo"
KOG_church_of_kongo_desc:0 "the kongo kingdom and the papacy have had a long history with eachother, Henrique Kinu a Mvemba, slave negotiation thing etc. the clergy also played an important role in kongo society in education"
KOG_foreign_studies:0 "Send our Sons Abroad"
KOG_foreign_studies_desc:0 "The seeds of the modern Kingdom of Kongo were planted several centuries ago through the Portuguese abduction of natives and nobles with their arrival on our shores. While they may have been hostages, the education and experience gained through their role as indigenous ambassadors highlighted the importance of this collaboration between Europe and our Kingdom. The fifth Manikongo, João I, understood this and had sent many of his principal nobles and sons to study and learn under Portugal. We shall follow in their stead and send our sons abroad to educate a new generation!"
KOG_traditionalist_revival:0 "Traditionalist Revival"
KOG_traditionalist_revival_desc:0 "Our alignment with the Portuguese has cost us dearly in our political realm! Rumors have arisen of discontent nobles who dare plot against the Manikongo with potential German backing due to the fears of the Kingdom becoming nothing more than a puppet to Portugal. Seeking to squash these rumors, the Manikongo will firmly entrench the kingdom in its tribalist roots and disavow any strings to Lisbon to ensure our sovereignty."
KOG_bakongo_practices:0 "Promote Bakongo Practices"
KOG_bakongo_practices_desc:0 "we shall lean more into the practices of our Bakongo faith while not fully abandoning catholicism"
KOG_tribalist_structures:0 "Embrace Tribalist Structures"
KOG_tribalist_structures_desc:0 "native practices such as the council of twelve advisors, royal guards are chosen, Bana ba Nzo (orphaned children raised in the royal court, became royal guards), pretty lax provincial laws"
KOG_masters_of_the_basin:0 "Masters of the Congo Basin"
KOG_masters_of_the_basin_desc:0 "For centuries our strategic location at the mouth of the Congo Basin has allowed our kingdom to control the flow of trade between the European powers and the vast riches of the Congo. With alternative overland routes being restricted by the chaos that has engulfed the entire continent, we will use our position to facilitate trade with the great powers of Europe."
KOG_fate_of_monarchy:0 "Fate of the House of Água Rosada"
KOG_fate_of_monarchy_desc:0 "Unlike a traditional monarchy, the position of the Manikongo is not hereditary. When a new king is chosen, an election is held among the twelve advisors to pick a new Manikongo, decide to keep it (elective monarchy subideo(?)) or centralize royal house under pedro"
KOG_native_universities:0 "Nativist Education Under our Faith"
KOG_native_universities_desc:0 "elite trade schools/secret societies(?) tied to the bakongo faith, any one could attend these schools but rigorous requirements to be accepted, training for government/medicines/civil service. Kimpasi, Kinkimba, Buelo, and Lemba were among these schools"
KOG_deal_for_mbanza_kongo:0 "Negotiate for M'banza-Kongo"

KOG_mouth_of_the_congo_desc:0 "to the south lies leopoldville and the surrounding mouth of the congo basin, we must secure the crown jewel of the congo to control trade. For both paths, wargoal for leopoldville/bas-congo/kinshasa area"

kog.9.d:0 "The drums of war often do not steadily beat - we find ourselves overextending ourselves in both supplies and manpower while our enemies continue to see success after success on a daily basis.

kog.13.d:0 "Though the Imperial Order of Our Lord Jesus Christ, or the Kongolese Kingdoms own Catholic knightly order, has existed in some form or another since 1607 when the Portuguese first brought the Order of Christ to our shores, it has largely decayed over the centuries, especially after its power and influence were severely truncated in 1914, when Portugal shifted it from a National Order, holding sway over the entire Kongolese Kingdom, to a largely powerless arm of the defanged monarchy as a House Order following the failed Kongo Revolt of 1914 and its aftermath in 1915 onwards which saw the Manikongo himself largely reduced to a powerless and puppeted facade in service to the colonial regime. Blah blah blah we revive the Order and have Knights again… can also mention João I the first voluntarily Catholic manikongo in Kongo history and name the revived order after him, and mention Sobas their special knight rank"

The Manikongo's kingdom has recently engaged in a war to reclaim the lands of the former Belgian Congo. With their victory, the vast natural resources of the Congo now lie in the domain of the Manikongo and their inclusion into our faction could greatly expand our influence in Africa.

Some have proposed that we should use Pedro VII’s coat of arms, first issued to Afonso I by the Portuguese, as our national banner. More traditionalist chiefs have suggested that we use the flag that was designed by Franciscan monks for Garcia II, a fiercely independent king who opposed the Portuguese in Angola. Some reformist thinkers have advocated that we modernize our current flag with a saltire that includes the coat of arms in the middle. Some however, don't see a need for change and we should continue to use the flag that has been in use for centuries."
