### Leader Bios ###

POLITICS_PEDRO_VII_DESC:0 "The current Manikong, Pedro VII do Congo, has reigned since 1923 as king of the Benikongo, though only recently has he physically taken a seat on his rightful throne. Forced into exile due to the German’s control of his homeland, this true African king has lived abroad in São Salvador in Angola, awaiting for his moment to reclaim his rightful throne, and Mittelfafrika’s collapse has provided just such a moment.Heavily supported and financed by Portugal and receiving direct aid from the Iberians through Angola, the Manikongo’s forces are surprisingly well armed for tribal rabble. Under their king, these fierce and savage waves of native troops wage war to conquer the former lands of the Kingdom of Kongo, claiming the kingdom owed to him by birthright as the most direct living heir to the last sovereign Manikongo."

### Ideas ###
KOG_reliance_on_portugal_idea:0 "Reliance on Portugal"
KOG_reliance_on_portugal_idea_desc:0 "For many decades, the Manikongo and the Portuguese have cooperated, bringing Christianity and Western customs to our Kongo. In exchange for allowing them to extract our land’s resources and to use our people for labor, we have gained their protection and their aid. However, the current Manikongo has long chafed under this uneven deal, slowly losing patience with his colonial ‘allies’, and many feel as though this partnership is not fated to last."
KOG_claims_of_greatness_idea:0 "Claims of Greatness"
KOG_claims_of_greatness_idea_desc:0 "We are the heirs of the Kongo Kingdom, and the one, true, and rightful lords of the vast Congo. However, most do not recognize this claim, especially given our weakened state, both unconnected from the heartland of our territory in northern Angola and separated from our kin in Bas-Congo. We must reclaim this destiny, though we will likely be forced to work with the Portuguese in order to achieve it." 

### Focuses ###

### Revolt Tree ###

KOG_manikongo_proclaimation:0 "The Manikongo's Proclamation"
KOG_manikongo_proclaimation_desc:0 "Exiled by the German forces, Pedro VII, the Manikongo, had spent the duration of his reign living in São Salvador. The Manikongo was  able to amend the Kingdom’s relationship with Lisbon, receiving funding and support to help destabilize Mittelafrika. With the fall of the colonial order, Pedro VII returned to his homeland, proclaiming himself the rightful king of the Bakongo, but these celebrations were cut short. The Manikongo finds his people besieged on all sides, the maniacal Leon M’ba seeks to return French rule to the Congo and the Anziku have launched an invasion to seize the local capital of Brazzaville. The Manikongo must effectively lead his people through the storm if he is to restore glory to his kingdom."
KOG_raid_german_armories:0 "Raid German Armories"
KOG_raid_german_armories_desc:0 "With the German order in Äquatorialafrika retreating to their colonial holdout in Kamerun, their hasty departure had left behind only the remains of their rule. Barracks that once swelled with the ranks of the Askari had been left to the vultures. Securing these abandoned stockpiles of weapons and ammunition will be invaluable in our fight for survival."
KOG_against_false_despots:0 "Against False Despots"
KOG_against_false_despots_desc:0 "Along the coast in Gabon, the corrupt Leon M’ba seeks to expand his kleptocracy at the expense of his own people. In the northeast, the ‘republicans’ of the Tshuapa Clique are led from the shadows by the demented she-witch Ngalifourou. Known to all as the ‘woman of the whites’, the Anziku queen wages war only to sell her own people. These tyrants have waged war against the Bakongo only to appease their French masters and return the Middle Congo to their rule."
KOG_question_lisbon:0 "Our Relationship with Lisbon"
KOG_question_lisbon_desc:0 "While the Manikongo has remained loyal to Lisbon, his recent arrival in Kongo has raised doubts about any continued ‘cooperation’. While a strong European ally would be beneficial towards retaining our independence, the scars left during the revolt of 1914 are still prevalent among the Bakongo, who are distrustful of the Portuguese. The shadow of Portugal looms over the Kingdom, and Pedro must decide whether to continue our close relationship with Lisbon or set forth a new path for the Kingdom."
KOG_request_portuguese_arms:0 "Request Portuguese Arms"
KOG_request_portuguese_arms_desc:0 "While we have made do with the arms from our initial expedition and the rifles we obtained from the German stockpiles, we find ourselves outgunned by our enemies who have received a steady flow of weapons from their French backers in Algiers. We will ask our allies in Lisbon to provide us with modern rifles to replace our German antiques and turn the tide of battle."
KOG_angolan_cacadores:0 "Call Upon the Caçadores"
KOG_angolan_cacadores_desc:0 "The Caçadores, or hunters, are among the elite of the Portuguese armed forces. Famed for their expert sharpshooting, these light regiments were recently reformed to protect Portuguese colonies against foreign raids and have helped retain order in the Ultramar. With the war against the maniacal M’ba and the Anziku still raging, we shall ask the colonial government in Luanda to provide us with an elite regiment to aid us in our struggle."
KOG_rally_the_homeland:0 "Rally the Homeland"
KOG_rally_the_homeland_desc:0 "In our battle against the tyrants who would hope to crush our people, we have suffered heavy casualties that are proving difficult to replace. To help fill our ranks, we shall use these figures to call upon our Bakongo kin who reside around the Congo Basin to join us in our fight for survival. We will call upon Bakongo elders to provide us with much needed reinforcements and appeal to those who are in the service of the remnant Force Publique to defect and join us in our crusade to save their own people rather than the profits of their colonial overlords."
KOG_assert_independence:0 "Assert our Independence"
KOG_assert_independence_desc:0 "A deviation from his previous stance towards cooperation with the Portuguese, the Manikongo has taken an assertive stance. Leaning into the Bakongo nationalists and tribal leaders, the Manikongo has begun to revoke previous treaties made with the Portuguese, ending his vassalage to Lisbon and ruling as a true sovereign monarch. While the colonial office in Luanda is outraged by the Manikongo’s betrayal, his new subjects have begun to rally behind their King."
KOG_manikongo_authority:0 "The Authority of the Manikongo"
KOG_manikongo_authority_desc:0 "No nation holds a greater claim to the lands along this basin apart from the Kingdom of Kongo. As opposed to these kleptocrats and pretenders who have waged war against us, the Manikongo, Pedro VII, descends from a line of dutiful elected chiefs from a Kingdom whose influence can be traced back nearly five hundred years. Our Kingdom made dealings with the great powers of Europe and the Papacy and dominated trade within the Congo Basin. With the fall of the colonial order in Africa, we shall rise once again to dominate these lands under the rule of the Manikongo."
KOG_push_against_teke:0 "Assault Against the Anziku"
KOG_push_against_teke_desc:0 "The people living under the ‘Tshuapa Clique’ are hopelessly led by a disorganized cabal locked in a power struggle. Torn between republican demagogues, socialists, and the shaman queen of the Anziku, this unstable polity only exists to return the whole of the Middle Congo to French oppression. To bring an end to this chaos, we shall lead a final and decisive campaign along the Congo River. The Anziku had once been vassals of our Kingdom, it’s time we remind them of that fact. "
KOG_peace_with_the_madman:0 "Peace with the Madman?"
KOG_peace_with_the_madman_desc:0 "While our warriors have fought bravely against the Gabonese, there appears to be no end in sight to this conflict as the frontlines grind to an utter halt. Being sparsely populated with our Bakongo kin, military occupation could greatly destabilize our kingdom and potentially incite another revolt. By utilizing Portugal’s connections to the powers of the Entente, we shall work to broker peace between our Kingdom and the Republic of Gabon."
