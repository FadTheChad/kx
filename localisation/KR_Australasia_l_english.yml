AST_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Australasia's union, despite being initially established under the brief martial law of Birdwood in 1924, has seen peaceful unity in recent years. The autonomy granted to New Zealand has allowed both members to bloom independently while maintaining a strong confederation. Although the economy suffered malaise due to the depression following the collapse of the British Empire, it has turned a corner with the Scullin Labor government and its Lyons Plan. Despite these promising developments, political chaos has ensued. Both major parties in Australian politics are fracturing, with the Scullin government splitting into three factions. Meanwhile, the Country Party has taken the caretaker prime minister position from its senior coalition partner, leaving New Zealand as the more stable member of the confederation. Amidst this political turmoil, the nation's future remains in the balance whether it will continue its upward trend or find a new future away from the political system of the past."

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_HENRY_WINDSOR_DESC_AST: "Prince Henry of Windsor, elder brother of the deceased Prince George, has been appointed Governor-General of Australasia. Though regarded as an extremely nervous child, Henry grew into an active and modest man. While Australasians appreciate Henry's virtue, the expectation among many in its government was that appointment to the post of Governor-General would be restored to the discretion of the Australasian parliament. Regardless of the disappointment of some, however, Henry is well liked. With the country still mourning from such a tragic air-crash, Henry toils diligently to ensure that Australasia is properly governed."
POLITICS_ALBERT_WINDSOR_DESC_AST: "Prince Albert of Windsor, elder brother of the deceased Prince George, has been appointed Governor-General of Australasia. Though ridiculed as a child for his noticeable stammer, Albert grew into a collected and dutiful man. While Australasians appreciate Albert's virtue, the expectation among many in its government was that appointment to the post of Governor-General would be restored to the discretion of the Australasian parliament. Regardless of the disappointment of some, however, Albert is well liked. With the country still mourning from such tragic air-crash, Albert toils diligently to ensure that Australasia is properly governed."
POLITICS_EDWARD_WINDSOR_DESC_AST: "The eldest son of the late King George V, Prince Edward hoped to be the standard bearer for the reclamation of his beloved Britain; a fate that would never come to be, as circumstances caused his fall from grace and eventual abdication from the throne of the land he loved so much. Forced to accept the conciliatory prize of Governor-General of Australia due to the tragic death of his brother, Edward toils diligently to ensure that Australasia is properly governed, despite the fact that Edward was seemingly only granted the post to get him out of the way of Canadian affairs... and because everyone else was either busy somewhere else, or dead."

Lyons' orthodox approach to economic depression had initially been popular with the business community. However, the plan's results failed to bear fruit, and its austerity measures severely impacted the nation's working class, eroding Labor's base of support. This ultimately led to the downfall of Scullin's second term and caused a split within the Labor Party.

### Focuses ###
AST_first_labor_victory:0 "The Labor Party's Resurgence"
AST_first_labor_victory_desc:0 "Against the odds and after the tumultuous downfall of Scullin, the Labor Party has clawed its way back to power. Despite internal schisms with Langists and socialists pulling in different directions, the party has united under a common banner of restoring dignity and prosperity to the working class."
AST_first_lang_labor_victory:0 "Lang Labor's Triumph"
AST_first_lang_labor_victory_desc:0 "In the wake of Labor's fracturing, Lang's decisive victory over his rivals has positioned him as the true champion of the working people. Bold policies and unwavering defiance of conservative orthodoxy have resonated with those who feel betrayed by the establishment."
AST_stay_with_the_lyons_plan:0 "Repackage the Lyons Plan"
AST_stay_with_the_lyons_plan_desc:0 "During the darkest days of the Depression, the Lyons Plan emerged as a pragmatic solution to placate the upper and middle class while rebuilding the economy. While expanding labour rights and protections it would also cut government spending with waves of austerity, austerity that eventually fractured the Labor Party. Now, under Forde's vision, we may balance the scales - reducing the cuts and expanding welfare so that the working class is not left behind as Lyons did."
AST_modernize_the_theodore_plan:0 "Revitalise the Theodore Plan"
AST_modernize_the_theodore_plan_desc:0
"The Theodore Plan, born out of Queensland's premier 'Red' Ted Theodore, offers a working class alternative to Lyons' conservatism. Embracing Keynesian ideals, it aimed to reject the status quo and elevate the working class through bold interventionist policies. The plan would feature an expansion of credit to farmers and small businesses through the issue of 'fiduciary notes' which could be redeemed after we fix the stagnant economy."
AST_implement_the_lang_plan:0 "Implement the Lang Plan"
AST_implement_the_lang_plan_desc:0 "Lang's defiance of austerity and rejection of England's unjust war debts are more than just political statements - they were a declaration of economic independence. His plan is centred on stimulating industrial growth, creating jobs, and ensuring fair wages for workers, all while investing heavily in public infrastructure and social welfare."
AST_end_the_repayment_of_war_debts:0 "Break the Chains of War Debt"
AST_end_the_repayment_of_war_debts_desc:0 "The war debts imposed by England, only owed because we fought and died for England, have long shackled our economy from resources we could use to fix the stagnation. With 275 million pounds owed at exorbitant interest rates, the time has come to cast off these financial chains. By refusing to pay the remaining debt, we assert our sovereignty and prioritise the welfare of our people over colonial obligations."
AST_extend_the_unions_in_the_workplace:0 "Restore Workplace Unionism"
AST_extend_the_unions_in_the_workplace_desc:0 "The Bruce government's assault on workplace representation left workers vulnerable to cruel bosses and unsafe conditions. Scullin's attempts to rebuild were tragically cut short in his second term, leaving the task unfinished. Now, we must take up the mantle and strengthen industrial relations laws, ensuring that unions have the power they need to protect workers' rights and maintain workplace stability."
AST_working_class_protectionism:0 "Protectionism for the Working Class"
AST_working_class_protectionism_desc:0 "Protectionism is more than just an economic policy; it's a shield for [AST.GetAdjective] workers against the flood of cheap foreign labor that threatens their livelihoods. By imposing tariffs and redirecting them to bolster secondary industries, we not only protect wages but also ensure that our economy grows in a way that benefits the working class."
AST_devolve_rights_to_the_states:0 "Restore State Sovereignty"
AST_devolve_rights_to_the_states_desc:0 "In response to Lang's policies the Federal government centralised power and eroded the autonomy that once defined [AST.GetNameDef]'s states. Recognizing the need to correct this imbalance, we are committed to devolving rights back to the states, allowing them to regain control over taxation and local governance."
AST_commonwealth_employees_furlough_act:0 "The Commonwealth Employees Furlough Act"
AST_commonwealth_employees_furlough_act_desc:0 "The Commonwealth Employees Furlough Act represents a significant step forward in securing the rights of public servants, offering them the time off they deserve while laying the groundwork for long-service leave in the private sector. This initiative not only enhances job security but also promotes a more balanced and productive workforce."
AST_bring_splitters_back_into_the_fold:0 "Reunite the Labor Factions"
AST_bring_splitters_back_into_the_fold_desc:0 "The Labor Party's descent into factionalism has left it fractured and ineffective, unable to present a cohesive vision for the nation. The time has come to heal these wounds, bringing the splintered factions back into the fold. The Langites and other Laborites who left us are welcome back with open arms as we build a proper united government"
AST_expand_maternity_and_pensions_for_widows:0 "Enhance Support for Widows and Maternity"
AST_expand_maternity_and_pensions_for_widows_desc:0 "As part of our broader commitment to social welfare, we will expand maternity benefits and pensions for widows, providing much-needed support to those who have lost their spouses. This initiative is more than just financial assistance; it's a recognition of the sacrifices made by these women and a commitment to ensuring they can live with dignity."
AST_use_labor_dailys_support:0 "Leverage Labor Daily's Influence"
AST_use_labor_dailys_support_desc:0 "Labor Daily, long dominated by Lang's faction, is a powerful tool for shaping public opinion and rallying support in South Australia and New South Wales. By expanding and harnessing its influence, we can align centrist Laborites with Lang's progressive policies, creating a unified front within the party."
AST_drag_the_actu_back:0 "Reclaim ACTU Allegiance"
AST_drag_the_actu_back_desc:0
"The ACTU, under the sway of Jock Garden's radicalism, has drifted from the core principles of Labor. To reclaim their support, we must moderate the ACTU's influence while expanding its role within our party. By offering concessions to leaders like Albert Monk and Percy Clarey, we can bring them back into our fold, strengthening our position and ensuring the ACTU aligns with our vision for [AST_Australasia_or_Australia]'s future."
AST_expand_the_commonwealth_office_of_education:0 "Elevate National Education"
AST_expand_the_commonwealth_office_of_education_desc:0
"The Commonwealth Office of Education is the cornerstone of our nation's educational infrastructure, but it must evolve to meet the demands of a modern [AST.GetName]. By expanding its reach and resources, we can ensure that every child has access to quality education, regardless of their background."
AST_face_down_the_white_army:0 "Confront the White Army Threat"
AST_face_down_the_white_army_desc:0 "The rise of paramilitary groups like the New Guard and the League of National Defence represents a dire threat to moderate Labor and union organising. These factions, often violent and extremist, aim to undermine our democratic institutions and impose their will through force. To secure our future, we must confront and dismantle these organisations, ensuring that [AST.GetNameDef] remains a nation governed by law and justice, not by the barrel of a gun."
AST_drag_jock_back_into_the_lang_gang:0 "Integrate Jock Into the Lang Gang"
AST_drag_jock_back_into_the_lang_gang_desc:0 "Jock Garden's failed bid for the prime ministership has left him isolated, yet his influence among the socialist faction remains strong. By reaching out and bringing him into Lang's camp, we can reunite the left-wing forces within the party, with Jock's previous relationship with Lang in the trades hall being key to his compliance."
AST_implement_the_goods_standard:0 "Implement the 'Goods Standard'"
AST_implement_the_goods_standard_desc:0 "The time has come to break free from the constraints of the gold standard that have long shackled our economy. By implementing the 'Goods Standard', we will redefine our economic measures based on the nation's whole value of goods and services produced, not its arbitrary gold reserves."
AST_australia's_oldest_party_stabilizes:0 "Labor's Soul Reforged"
AST_australia's_oldest_party_stabilizes_desc:0 "After years of internal strife and factionalism, the Labor Party has emerged from the crucible of conflict stronger and more unified than ever. The re-aligning of the Langites and socialist factions has solidified a foundation built on social justice, worker solidarity, and a clear vision for [AST.GetNameDef]'s future. As the dust settles, the party stands ready to lead the nation with renewed purpose and unwavering resolve."
AST_lang_is_right:0 "Lang is Right!"
AST_lang_is_right_desc:0 "The victory of Jack Lang over Federal Labor marks a decisive moment in [AST.GetAdjective] politics. Lang's unwavering commitment to rejecting austerity and defending the working class has resonated with the people, proving that his vision for a fairer, more independent [AST.GetName] is not just possible but essential."

AST_second_labor_victory:0 "Labor Will Finish the Job"
AST_second_labor_victory_desc:0 "Riding the waves of economic recovery and party unity, the Labor Party secures a second term in office, reaffirming its place as the steadfast guardian of the working class. In a world teetering on the edge of chaos, Labor's leadership provides a beacon of stability and hope, much like it did during the trials of the Great War. This victory is not just a mandate to govern, but a testament to the enduring legacy of the Labor movement.
AST_second_lang_labor_victory:0 "The Big Fella's Unyielding Resolve"
AST_second_lang_labor_victory_desc:0 Jack Lang's re-election cements his vision of a democratic and independent [AST.GetName], where the welfare of its citizens takes precedence over foreign debts and capitalist interests. Lang's unyielding resolve has reshaped the political landscape, setting the course for a nation unafraid to chart its own destiny."
AST_establish_university_commission:0 "The University Commission's Minds of Tomorrow"
AST_establish_university_commission_desc:0 "Building upon the educational reforms of previous terms, the establishment of a University Commission marks a significant investment in [AST.GetNameDef]'s future. By focusing on higher education, we aim to cultivate the minds that will drive national growth and innovation in the coming decades."
AST_conscription_limited_to_defense:0 "Conscription Limited to Defence"
AST_conscription_limited_to_defense_desc:0 "Despite Labor's historical stance against conscription, the growing regional threats have forced us to reconsider our position. By limiting conscription strictly to defence, we strike a delicate balance between upholding our principles and ensuring [AST.GetNameDef]'s security."
AST_protect_the_national_magna_carta:0 "Protect the National Magna Carta"
AST_protect_the_national_magna_carta_desc:0 "The White [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] Policy, referred to as the National Magna Carta by Lang, is a cornerstone of organised labor's influence on the economy. Despite increasing pressure from liberals and within our own ranks, we must stand firm in defending these policies. To protect the livelihoods of [AST.GetAdjective] native workers, we must ensure that our immigration laws continue to block the entrance of cheap foreign workers."
AST_take_control_of_state_income_tax:0 "Taxation Federalised for a Stronger Nation"
AST_take_control_of_state_income_tax_desc:0 "The economic decentralisation of state income tax has long hindered our ability to effectively govern and support the nation as a whole. By centralising control under the federal [AST.GetAdjective] Taxation Office, we aim to streamline fiscal policies and ensure equitable distribution of resources."
AST_every_australian_at_the_service_of_the_government:0 "Every [AST.GetAdjective] at the Service of the Government"
AST_every_australian_at_the_service_of_the_government_desc:0 "The War Cabinet has issued a directive for the complete mobilisation of all resources - human and material - for the defence of Australia. This unprecedented measure leaves no room for dissent; every [AST.GetAdjective], regardless of their personal desires, must be prepared to serve the government in this time of need. It is a call to arms for the entire nation, a reminder that in the face of existential threats, unity and sacrifice are paramount."
AST_commonwealth_unemployment_and_sickness_benefits_act:0 "Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act"
AST_commonwealth_unemployment_and_sickness_benefits_act_desc:0 "As our nation's welfare state expands, it has become clear that a robust social safety net is essential to protect our citizens from the harsh realities of unemployment and illness. The Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act is a landmark piece of legislation that aims to provide financial support to those in need, ensuring that no [AST.GetAdjective] is left to face hard times alone."
AST_make_the_banks_bow:0 "Break the Chains of Finance"
AST_make_the_banks_bow_desc:0 "For too long, the banks have held [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] hostage to their interests, prioritising profits over the well-being of the nation. The time has come to bring these financial giants to heel. By asserting governmental control over the banking sector and imposing strict regulations, we will redirect financial resources toward national growth and public welfare, ensuring that the [AST.GetAdjective] people, not the banks, are the true beneficiaries of our economy."
AST_reduce_the_control_of_the_governor_general:0 "Break the Vestiges of Nobility's Power"
AST_reduce_the_control_of_the_governor_general_desc:0 "The Governor General's influence over our government is a relic of colonial rule that must be curtailed to reflect the true democratic will of the [AST.GetAdjective] people. Just as Jack Lang was unlawfully removed from his premiership in New South Wales, so too must we confront the federal Governor General's power. The question remains: How far will we go to dismantle this vestige of nobility and colonial tradition, and what will rise in its place?"
AST_expand_non-white_access_to_pensions_welfare_and_maternity_support:0 " Expand Non-White Access to Government Support"
AST_expand_non-white_access_to_pensions_welfare_and_maternity_support_desc:0 "In our pursuit of justice, it is imperative that all [AST.GetAdjective]s, regardless of race, have access to the welfare benefits that ensure a dignified life. This initiative seeks to expand pensions, welfare, and maternity support to non-white communities, helping to create a stronger welfare system.  While we continue to prioritise the welfare of the white working class, this legislation recognizes that true equality means lifting everyone up, preventing employers from exploiting a second-class citizenry."
AST_nationalize_qantas:0 "Nationalise Airways and Qantas"
AST_nationalize_qantas_desc:0 "To secure [AST_Australasia_or_Australia]'s air transport and ensure it serves the public good, we will bring Qantas under national ownership. This move will guarantee affordable and reliable air travel, enhance national security, and create jobs, driving forward our economic and social development. Nationalising Qantas is not just about taking control of an airline; it's about ensuring that the skies above belong to the people of [AST_Australasia_or_Australia]."
AST_pharmaceutical_benefits_scheme:0 "The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme"
AST_pharmaceutical_benefits_scheme_desc:0 "By implementing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, we will make essential medications affordable and accessible to all [AST.GetAdjective]s.

AST_break_syndicalist_5th_column:0 "Exclude syndicalism from Labour"
AST_break_syndicalist_5th_column_desc:0 "The syndicalist elements within our nation are a direct threat to stability and most importantly the labour movement itself.

AST_the_nation_turns_to_labor:0 "The Nation Turns to Labor"
AST_the_nation_turns_to_labor_desc:0 "When the nation faces unprecedented challenges, the people have always turned to the Labor Party for leadership and vision. As Australia faced the crucible of the Great War or when the economy collapsed in the wake of the war, the Labor Party rose to the occasion, restoring stability and hope.

AST_lang_greater_than_lenin:0 "Lang, Greater than Lenin"
AST_lang_greater_than_lenin_desc:0 "Jack Lang's vision for [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] surpasses even the boldest dreams of revolutionary leaders like Lenin. While socialist regimes in Paris and London descend into tyranny and chaos, [AST_Australasia_or_Australia], under Lang's leadership, has forged a new path, one that combines social justice with economic equality without compromising on democracy. Through a series of sweeping reforms, we have elevated our nation to unprecedented heights, prioritising the rights of workers with a world class modern economy with a protected sense of national unity."

This victory will cement Labor's commitment to creating a fairer, more equitable [AST_Australasia_or_Australia], a peace far better than the one that followed the Great War."
AST_third_lang_labor_victory:0 "Lang's Helmsmanship in a New Era"
AST_third_lang_labor_victory_desc:0 "Jack Lang's leadership has guided us through the most turbulent times in our nation's history. Now, as [AST.GetNameDef] emerges from the shadow of war, the people have chosen to continue Lang's bold vision for a reformed [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] that truly represents its working class. With this post-war victory, Lang's Labor government is poised to build a lasting peace through comprehensive reforms that will ensure a fairer, more prosperous future for all [AST.GetAdjective]s."

AST_commonwealth_reconstruction_and_training_scheme:0 "Commonwealth Reconstruction and Training Scheme"
AST_commonwealth_reconstruction_and_training_scheme_desc:0 "The devastation of war has left deep scars on our nation, and the task of rebuilding is monumental.

AST_implement_the_commonwealth_bank_act_desc:0 "The Commonwealth Bank Act is a crucial step towards establishing a stable and resilient financial system in [AST_Australasia_or_Australia].

AST_the_question_of_bank_nationalization_desc:0 "The question of bank nationalisation is one of the most critical issues facing our government.

# INTRO EVENTS # 1-100

austral.1.t:0 "The Status of the Confederation"
austral.1.d:0 "Formed in 1925 as a result of the Consolidation of Resources Act, the Australasian Confederation combined the British Australasian Dominions of Australia and New Zealand, as well as the territories of British New Guinea and Fiji. The years since the Weltkrieg brought great change and hardship as the war strained both society and the economy, which manifested in the short-lived Melbourne Commune led by the Victorian Socialist Party. Although brutally put down by the Hughes government, denounced by the Labor opposition, and suppressed by demobilised Australian Imperial Force veterans, it was a sign of the hard times ahead.\n\nWhen the British Revolution of 1925 shook the Empire to its core, it left Australia and New Zealand without their main trading partner while Germany encroached further, taking New Caledonia and threatening the Tasman Sea between the dominions. As a result emergency protocols were implemented, suspending elections and appointing William Birdwood as Governor-General. For three years, Birdwood ruled as an empowered national protector alongside his ally, Billy Hughes' Nationalist Party, under a combined Australasia as it stabilised and prepared for democracy.\n\nNew Zealand was reorganised into an Autonomy with its own parliament and legislative council inside Australasia, free to pass legislation locally and be free of federal interference but also unable to be represented federally. Its Prime Minister stands with the federal head of government, deciding on foreign policy and representing the nation on the world stage."
austral.1.a:0 "In 1928 elections were held..."

austral.2.t:0 "The Status of Federal Politics"
austral.2.d:0 "In the first elections since Birdwood temporarily suspended them, the National Party won again due to the red scare of a socialist victory so soon after the fall of England. In a twist of fortune, Hughes was ousted as the newly formed Country Party won enough seats to force the Nationalists into a coalition, the main term being the removal of Hughes. Stanley Bruce served for one term, but his efforts to dismantle the nation's system of arbitration, his failure to improve the stagnated economy, and decades of National Party rule ended his tenure.\n\nJames Scullin, now leader of the Labor Party, ran on negotiation and conciliation between the classes and presented himself as a moderate, far from the image of the syndicalist menace. The appointment of Joseph 'Honest Joe' Lyons, former Premier of Tasmania, as his Treasurer rather than the former Queensland Premier Ted Theodore, further cemented this image. While the labour movement formed a united front to elect Scullin, the honeymoon ended with the implementation of the Lyons Plan, a solution to drag Australia out of economic stagnation. A mix of financial orthodoxy, industrial relations reforms, and austerity, the plan split the party. Over three years, internal conflicts arose as both the Theodore and Lang plans promised a Keynesian approach to stimulating the economy. Although the economy improved, many in the working class saw little benefit. The announcement of further austerity cuts by the Treasurer ultimately ripped the Scullin government apart, with Jack Beasley and Jock Garden representing the Federal Lang Labor Party and the Socialist Labor Party respectively, voting in no confidence."
austral.2.a:0 "With the Nationalists buckling Earle Page took the role as the Prime Minister."

austral.3.t:0 "The Passing of King George V"
austral.3.d:0 "News has reached from the Canadian Ambassador of the death of King George V this morning in his sleep. Grief and sadness has gripped our nation with the news of the death of the last monarch to rule the Isles. Though Australasia has not suffered as much as the English did during the revolution, we must share in their sorrows and make sure the memory of this exile be just a footnote in history forgotten by all who lived through it."
austral.3.a:0 "The King died yearning for something just beyond the waves."

austral.4.t:0 "The Caretaker Prime Minister"
austral.4.d:0 "In a twist of fate, Earle Page has ascended to the position of Prime Minister of Australasia. With the fall of the Scullin government, the once-mighty Labor Party splintered into three factions yet despite these divisions, Labor remains the largest party, leaving the Nationalists unable to govern effectively without broader support.\n\nEarle Page, previously the Deputy Prime Minister, has seized this rare opportunity to steer the government. However, the road ahead is fraught with challenges. The Page Ministry's lack of popularity is palpable. Urban voters, feeling neglected and resentful of the rural favouritism, are increasingly disillusioned. This discontent may set the stage for a resurgence of the Labor remnants, despite their recent fragmentation."
austral.4.a:0 "Countrymindedness rules"

austral.5.t:0 "The Split in the ALP's Corpse"
austral.5.d:0 "The once-unified Labor Party has splintered into three distinct factions. Jock Garden leads the Socialist Labor Party, promising to achieve the socialist objective through democratic means. The Langists, composed of disillusioned moderates, trade unionists who oppose socialism but demand radical reforms and those loyal to Langs vision, have also broken away. This fragmentation ripped apart Labor's supply and confidence and brought down the Scullin government.\n\nDespite these divisions, the combined Labor factions still hold a majority in Parliament, effectively blocking any coalition legislation and deadlocking the government. The remaining Labor members are divided into two camps: one led by Frank Forde, who aims to revive and modify the Lyons Plan to better support the working class, and the other led by John Curtin, who advocates for the ambitious Keynesian Theodore Plan to stimulate the economy from the bottom up."
austral.5.a:0 "Unite or die."

austral.6.t:0 "The Nationalists Buckle"
austral.6.d:0 "After a crucial vote brought down the Scullin government, the Nationalist Party, led by John Latham, took control. However, Latham's inability to pass legislation against the dominant Labor factions led to his downfall before a new election could be called to push out the Labor remnants. Internal party strife saw Latham ousted by Hughes, who held a grudge from his ousting, and Menzies, who sought leadership. Progressive liberals led by Charles Merret within the party also turned against Latham due to disagreements over economic and social policies, becoming independent members in parliament. In this turmoil, Deputy Prime Minister Earle Page became the caretaker Prime Minister, refusing to call an election to hold the position of PM. The Country Party now sees a prime opportunity to force the Nationalists into concessions for ministerial positions and policy changes."
austral.6.a:0 "Both major parties at an impasse."

austral.9.t:0 "A Secret Accord Between the AFAL and the White Army"
austral.9.d:0 "As socialist sentiments rise within Australasia, conservative forces have mobilised to oppose any potential SLP victory. The White Army, composed of the New Guard, the Old Guard, and the League of National Security, has formed alliances to counter the socialist threat. The All for [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] League, an alternative conservative movement rising in opposition to the Nationalists, with significant overlap in membership has agreed to support the White Army, promising protection from the law in exchange for political backing.\n\nWith many members of the defence forces affiliated with these organisations, it is clear that an SLP victory will not be met peacefully. They are prepared to defend their vision of Australasia, potentially leading to a violent clash should the socialists come to power."
austral.9.a:0 "We stand ready."

austral.10.t:0 "1936 [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] Labor Party Leadership Election"
austral.10.d:0 "Labor is deeply divided between two factions. Frank Forde represents the moderate to centre Laborites who advocate for the reimplementation of a new worker-centric Lyons plan. In contrast, John Curtin leads the centre to left Laborites, who push for a Keynesian approach to economic growth. With a party election to determine which faction will lead the results is that..."
austral.10.a:0 "John Curtin wins!"
austral.10.b:0 "Frank Forde wins!"

austral.11.t:0 "Leadership Spill in New Zealand"
austral.11.d:0 "When the Act of Consolidation was passed, New Zealand, amidst a complete economic collapse and the encroachment of Germany, was initially unwilling to join Australia if it would be reduced to a mere state. Consequently, it was agreed that New Zealand's Parliament and Legislative Council would operate independently of Australia. While New Zealand could not vote federally it retained legislative autonomy within its borders and its Prime Minister stood alongside the Australasian Prime Minister on matters of foreign affairs and national representation.\n\nWilliam Massey led the nation during its transition, with Joseph Ward replacing him to lead the United Party in the first elections. Ward faced strong resistance from both the Reform and Labour parties, leading to the United Party losing votes from both the left and the right. In 1931, William Nosworthy won the election for the Reform Party and served two terms. However, the increasing failure of the economy, due to neglect of funds by the federal government, left his ministry increasingly unpopular.\n\nNow William Noosworthy has been ousted from the position by his own party, the Reform Party, due to his lacklustre leadership and engagement. Now replaced with Gordon Coates who has been seen as a strong candidate having been a strong campaigner and charismatic in his previous roles. Despite the leadership change, the state of the New Zealand economy remains dire and the Reform Party's popularity continues to wane. With the Labour party agitating the New Zealand political landscape is turbulent as the nation seeks a way out of economic malaise."
austral.11.a:0 "Coates has his work cut out for him."

austral.12.t:0 "Earle Page Sets Out His Terms"
austral.12.d:0 "In recent speeches Earle Page has publicly stated his disdain for Hughes and Menzies, stating that he will refuse to serve under them and will need significant concessions to reform the coalition. Upon this speech hitting the newspapers, anger shook the Nationalists having the unintended effect of bolstering support for both Hughes and Menzies, shaking up this race for nominee."
austral.12.a:0 "It's anyone's game"

austral.13.t:0 "1936 Nationalist Party Leadership Election"
austral.13.d:0 "The Nationalists are set to decide their new leader amidst chaos and the looming presence of the Country Party. Stanley Bruce and John Latham, who share similar support bases, have formed a tentative alliance with one expected to step down in favour of the more popular candidate. Meanwhile, Hughes and Menzies continue to push their separate agendas. In the end the elected member is..."
austral.13.a:0 "Billy Hughes!"
austral.13.b:0 "Stanley Bruce!"
austral.13.c:0 "John Latham!"
austral.13.e:0 "Robert Menzies!"

austral.14.t:0 "Page Gives Way to the Nats"
austral.14.d:0 "Earle Page, with an established relationship with Latham and Bruce, has agreed to rejoin the coalition after securing concessions paving the way for a unified front in the next election. However his animosity towards Hughes and Menzies remains strong, preventing full collaboration."
austral.14.a:0 "Finally some stability."

austral.15.t:0 "Page Refuses to Kiss the Ring"
austral.15.d:0 "Earle Page has openly refused to join a coalition with Hughes and Menzies, causing friction within the Nationalist Party. Initially supported by his party, Page's intransigence is now seen as a threat to their electoral prospects. As the coalition struggles to hold together, Page's actions may be leading to his unravelling."
austral.15.a:0 "A dangerous gambit."

austral.16.t:0 "The Governor General Passes a Writ for an Early Election"
austral.16.d:0 "With the Nationalist leadership in chaos, lacking confidence in the House, and the three divided Labor factions too fragmented to govern effectively the governor general has called an election. The Governor-General will dissolve both the senate and parliament and have new elections to break the deadlock. Further with this New zealand will have new elections to coincide with the new federal mandate."
austral.16.a:0 "Perhaps this will end this chaos?"

austral.18.t:0 "An Approach to the Labor Reconciliation"
austral.18.d:0 "As Labor attempts to reunite its three factions, a Special Federal Conference has occurred in an attempt to reconcile the Labor Party. The electoral chances of the Labor Party are understood by all factions, if Labor does not unite it will not win the next election. Despite this it seems this unity conference has instead become a poaching session with each party attempting to sway members to support their faction. With the outcome of this conference whatever party is able to manoeuvre the more candidates may be in the prime position to be the legitimate Labor Party."
austral.18.a:0 "The ALP stands as the main faction."
austral.18.b:0 "Lang Labor is able to sway many delegates its way."
austral.18.c:0 "The SLP gains more legitimacy from the conference."

austral.19.t:0 "The All for Australasia League Seizes on the [AST.GetAdjective] Industries Protection League"
austral.19.d:0 "The prime battle between the All for [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] League and the Nationalists has not been in speeches nor in electoral districts. Instead it has been waged in the home of industrialists, the meetings of bankers and the councils of business men that are integral to the nation's growth. The AFAL has found its stage against the Nationalist establishment in attempting to sway the rich and powerful of the nation to its cause. The most important is the [AST.GetAdjective] Industries Protection League made up of the most important businessmen in [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] and has been split between supporters of the Nationalists and the AFAL for some time. With the flipping of key individuals on the council the official party that the league supports and funds has changed, leaving the Nationalists without a paddle. With the AFAL having a strong power base in the middle class, this change may sway many in the upper echelons of business, splitting the vote for the Nationalists further."
austral.19.a:0 "A massive development."

austral.21.t:0 "A Battle for the Trades Hall"
austral.21.d:0 "Centers of union activity, particularly the Trades Halls, are now battlegrounds for the three Labor factions. Jock Garden's influence over the unions is formidable, with many unions aligned with his trade hall reds. In response, the federal government is leveraging the conservative Australasian Workers' Union AWU to counteract Garden's dominance. The main front is found in the New South Wales trade hall, the centre of both Lang and Jocks power as both attempt to sway the hall's resources in their direction. The result of a fierce struggle for control over the nation's unions is..."
austral.21.a:0 "The ALP takes control"
austral.21.b:0 "Unions defect support to Lang!"
austral.21.c:0 "Jock ingrains himself more in the union structure."

austral.23.t:0 "Progressive liberals leave the nats"
austral.23.d:0 ""
austral.23.a:0 ""

austral.24.t:0 "Federal Labor Intervenes Against the Reds"
austral.24.d:0 "With the [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] Council of Trade Unions leaning towards the Socialist Labor Party rather than mainstream Labor after its adoption of the socialist objective, the ALP is launching a campaign to bring union voters back. Led by Percy Clarey and supported by moderate unions such as the Federated Clerks Union and the Amalgamated Food Preservers' Union, this effort aims to rebuild Labor unity. The loyalty of the anti-socialist AWU, led by Tom Dougherty, is also playing a crucial role in this strategy. The current leader of the ACTU Albert Monk, while defecting to the SLP, is a moderate and may be swayed back to the ALP."
austral.24.a:0 "ACTU moderates back the ALP."
austral.24.b:0 "The moderates stay with the SLP."

austral.26.t:0 "The Coalition Makes Its Choice"
austral.26.d:0 "Facing threats from both the left, with the split Labor Party, and the right, with the All for [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] League, the Nationalist-Country coalition is in a precarious position. Internal divisions within the Nationalists and the opportunistic moves by the Country Party are faustral.2urther destabilising the coalition, making their political future uncertain. Will the Country Party and the Nationals reform the coalition and if so who should have primacy?"
austral.26.a:0 "The Nationalists appease the Country Party and reform the coalition."
austral.26.b:0 "The County Party is able to take primacy of the coalition."
austral.26.c:0 "The Nationalists are unable to put the Country Party in its place and the coalition breaks."

austral.27.t:0 "The Parties Stabilise Ahead of the Election"
austral.27.d:0 "After months of political chaos, the major parties have finally ceased their infighting to prepare for the upcoming election. The Labor factions have fallen behind the dominant of the 3 and while running separate candidates have agreed to give supply to the major faction if they win while the Nationalists and Country Party have reached a tenuous peace. Meanwhile, the AFAL remains a significant threat, aiming to upend the established political order."
austral.27.a:0 "The ALP, AFAL and Nationalist - Country will compete"
austral.27.b:0 "Lang Labor, AFAL and Nationalist - Country will compete"
austral.27.c:0 "The SLP, AFAL and Nationalist - Country will compete"

austral.29.t:0 "The Party Revolts Against Fadden"
austral.29.d:0 "Earle Page's reaction to the new Nationalist leader has caused significant issues within the party. In response, a movement to remove him has gained traction.

austral.103.d:0 "William Birdwood's tenure as Governor-General saw a vast expansion in powers available to the position, which he used to maintain order in Oceania at the expense of democracy and civil liberties. Birdwood, a British General from the Weltkrieg, was imposed upon [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] by an Empire fearful of revolt... but times have changed, and the newly-elected government could use this opportunity to replace him with a native [AST_Australasia_or_Australia], or replace him with the well-liked governor of New South Wales, Sir Alexander Hore-Ruthven. While this move would be popular with many, others have suggested that an opportunity exists to invite a member of the royal family to assume the role and thus put [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] more firmly within the sphere of the Empire and our fellow Entente allies. Another suggestion for Governor-General is former White Rajah Charles Vyneer Brooke, who has been a famed socialiser in Sydney.

austral.154.d:0 "The government has put forward a referendum to allow federal legislation to deal with syndicalists, seeking to amend the [AST.GetAdjective] Constitution to allow the government to ban the Socialist Labor Party and any associated organisations in peace time. The proposal is driven by fears of syndicalist influence such as that during the English revolution and is opposed by the laborites, trade unionists and many liberals due to its restriction on political freedoms.

This proposal aims to streamline and centralise financial management, providing more stability and uniformity in handling debt obligations. Despite its practical financial rationale, the referendum faces opposition from those wary of increasing federal power at the expense of state autonomy. Lang has been the primary opposition to this amendment arguing this as the federal government attempts to take finance away from the sway of local state leaders. It is now put to the people to decide if such power should be in the hands of the state."

This ambitious proposal aims to address the challenges of rebuilding the nation after war to ensure a stable peace compared to the one that followed the Great War. The specifics of these points are that it will allow the federal government to legislate on a broad range of issues, including employment, health, education, and civil rights. Labor argued that centralised authority was essential for effective post-war reconstruction and ensuring equitable distribution of resources. Strongly opposed by the Nationalists as a form of syndicalism, the depression that followed for years is still fresh in people's minds, giving the referendum a strong chance to pass. It is now put to the people to decide if such power should be in the temporary hands of the state."

His early experiences in rural [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] instilled in him a deep empathy for the struggles of ordinary [AST.GetAdjective]s, a trait that defined his political career. Chifley left school at the age of 13 to become a locomotive cleaner and later a fireman. By 1914, he had worked his way up to become a locomotive driver. His involvement in the labour movement began in earnest during his years on the railways. Chifley became an active member of the [AST.GetAdjective] Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen, where he developed a reputation as a strong advocate for workers' rights and a skilled negotiator. His leadership in the 1917 General Strike, where he fought for better wages and working conditions, cemented his status as a prominent Labor leader.\n\nChifley's formal political career began in 1928 when he was elected as the Labor member for Macquarie in the House of Representatives. Known for his intellectual rigour and commitment to social justice, he played a crucial role in policy formulation. His vision for [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] was of a fair and equitable society, where the government ensured the welfare of its citizens. Working as John Curtin's second-in-command, Chifley's contributions laId the foundation of his current implementation of progressive vision for the nation."

His decade-long tenure was marked by a series of landmark decisions that showcased his commitment to civil liberties and social justice. Evatt often found himself in the minority, advocating for interpretations of the Constitution that emphasises individual rights and federal balance. Notable cases during his time included a Bank Nationalisation Case, where he argued for the government's power to nationalise banks, reflecting his belief in the need for state intervention in the economy during times of crisis.\n\nEvatt's judicial philosophy was deeply influenced by his broader concerns about social equity and democracy. He is known for his eloquent and forceful opinions, which often highlighted the importance of protecting the rights of individuals against overreach by state and federal governments.

He argued that socialist infiltration within the labour movement was part of a broader strategy to destabilise the country and pave the way for a communist takeover. Purging his party of their influence and the unions that aligned itself with him, Lang also supported many measures against capitalist or conservative attacks, fighting against Catholic work Groupers and scabs where they arise."

Initially supported by farmers in the Mallee region, the VFU grew rapidly, reaching 14,817 members across 547 branches by 1920. It advocated for fair prices, reduced transportation costs, and equitable land policies. On September 26, 1917, the VFU renamed its political wing to the Country Party, establishing the states wing of the Country Party. However, in 1925, a split occurred when John Hall and his supporters left to form the Primary Producers' Union due to dissatisfaction with the VFU's political direction. In response, the VFU rebranded as the Victorian Country Party in 1927, expanding its membership to include all country residents rather than restricting to just producers. The two Country parties merged into the United Country Party in 1930. Recently, another split arose when Victorian federal MP John McEwen was expelled for supporting the federal Coalition government, leading to the formation of the Liberal Country Party in Victoria."

austral.804.d:0 "Echium plantagineum, commonly known as Paterson's Curse, was introduced to Australia in the 1880s as an ornamental plant. However, it quickly spread beyond gardens, becoming a pervasive and invasive weed, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. The plant's rapid proliferation posed serious challenges to agriculture, as it competed aggressively with crops and pastureland. Its toxicity to livestock added to its notoriety, making it a significant problem for farmers.\n\nOur government has increased efforts to control Paterson's Curse including various biological control measures and public awareness campaigns. Researchers and agricultural authorities have gained further funding and are working to find effective solutions to mitigate its impact, leading to the development of integrated weed management strategies."

Waking at dawn, he juggles multiple tasks: drafting speeches, managing property transactions by phone, contacting his banker, and arranging itineraries, all simultaneously. His photographic memory and problem-solving skills were offset by a reckless audacity, with him to topple Hughes and recently attempt a deposition of the Nationals. Viewing issues through his rural base, Page consistently won concessions for his constituents. His shrewdness and adeptness at political chicanery left a solid legacy of practical achievements. His friend Drummond noted that Page's ideas 'fertilised the political thought of [AST_Australasia_or_Australia],' while opponent Jack Lang admired his unusually 'constructive' mindset."

Ley's influence in the movement was marked by his passionate speeches, organising skills, and ability to galvanise public support. He successfully pushed for stricter licensing laws and advocated for the establishment of "dry" zones where the sale of alcohol was prohibited. However recently demand for alcohol has spiked with pressure being against Ley to compromise for the sake of his electorate and party.

Born on August 13, 1882, in Scotland, Garden migrated to Australia in 1904 and quickly became a key figure in the labour movement. He initially worked as a carpenter and joiner, but his passion for workers' rights soon led him to become an active trade unionist and political organiser.\n\n Garden's early years in Australia were marked by his involvement in the Industrial Workers of the World, where he advocated for direct action and industrial unionism. His commitment to socialist principles was evident, and in 1920, he played a pivotal role in founding the Communist Party of [AST_Australasia_or_Australia]. Garden served as the CPA's first General Secretary, helping to establish its organisational structure and political agenda.\n\nDespite his initial enthusiasm for communism, Garden's relationship with the CPA began to sour by the mid-1920s. He grew increasingly critical of the party's strict adherence to bolshevik ideology after the fall of Lenin and its unwillingness to adapt to the [AST.GetAdjective] context. This disillusionment led him to break with the CPA and shift his focus towards more pragmatic and reformist approaches within the broader labour movement.\n\nGarden's break from the CPA did not diminish his influence. He became a key figure within the SLP and used his position in the trades hall and unions to benefit the working man, supporting the founding of the ACTU. In his biggest move Jock attempted to take the position of Prime minister with an open and proud socialist platform. With the obvious result of that run being clear now, Jock has taken the top job now, working to advance the class's struggle no matter what."
