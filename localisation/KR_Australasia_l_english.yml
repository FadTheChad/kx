### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_HENRY_WINDSOR_DESC_AST: "Prince Henry of Windsor, elder brother of the deceased Prince George, has been appointed Governor-General of Australasia. Though regarded as an extremely nervous child, Henry grew into an active and modest man. While Australasians appreciate Henry's virtue, the expectation among many in its government was that appointment to the post of Governor-General would be restored to the discretion of the Australasian parliament. Regardless of the disappointment of some, however, Henry is well liked. With the country still mourning from such a tragic air-crash, Henry toils diligently to ensure that Australasia is properly governed."
POLITICS_ALBERT_WINDSOR_DESC_AST: "Prince Albert of Windsor, elder brother of the deceased Prince George, has been appointed Governor-General of Australasia. Though ridiculed as a child for his noticeable stammer, Albert grew into a collected and dutiful man. While Australasians appreciate Albert's virtue, the expectation among many in its government was that appointment to the post of Governor-General would be restored to the discretion of the Australasian parliament. Regardless of the disappointment of some, however, Albert is well liked. With the country still mourning from such tragic air-crash, Albert toils diligently to ensure that Australasia is properly governed."
POLITICS_EDWARD_WINDSOR_DESC_AST: "The eldest son of the late King George V, Prince Edward hoped to be the standard bearer for the reclamation of his beloved Britain; a fate that would never come to be, as circumstances caused his fall from grace and eventual abdication from the throne of the land he loved so much. Forced to accept the conciliatory prize of Governor-General of Australia due to the tragic death of his brother, Edward toils diligently to ensure that Australasia is properly governed, despite the fact that Edward was seemingly only granted the post to get him out of the way of Canadian affairs... and because everyone else was either busy somewhere else, or dead."

### Ideas ###
AST_oversized_fleet:0 "Oversized Fleet"
AST_oversized_fleet_desc:0 "In the chaotic aftermath of Britain's downfall, many ships fled to Australasia to find refuge - far more than could be maintained in the country's meagre ports. Even with many ships mothballed (4 battleships, 2 armoured cruisers, and almost 50 smaller ships), it still is too much for Australia to handle. A solution needs to be found."
AST_upgrading_reserve:0 "Upgrading Naval Reserve"
AST_depression_1:0 "Economic Depression"
AST_depression_1_desc:0 "Australasia's economy was never particularly strong, and the aftermath of the Weltkrieg has only made it much, much worse.

AST_anzac_spirit_1:0 "ANZAC Spirit"
AST_anzac_spirit_1_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the Australian and New Zealanders were the most aggressive, and managed to keep their form in spite of their questionable discipline. Out of the line they were undoubtedly difficult to handle, but once in it they loved a fight. They were a curious mixture of toughness and sentimentality."

With the British Pacific Fleet having fled to our ports, we found ourselves in possession of a fleet that far outstrips our ability to properly manage them. This is our first and foremost issue."
AST_upgrade_facilities:0 "Legacy of John Jellicoe's report"

AST_upgrade_reserve_desc:0 "Many of the Pacific Fleet's ships were mothballed after the Weltkrieg ended, as we simply did not have the sailors to man them.

### Events ###

austral.1.t:0 "Status of the Confederation"
austral.1.d:0 "Formed in 1924 as a result of the Consolidation Of Resources Act, the Australasian Confederation is the combination of the British Australasian Dominions, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the territories of British New Guinea and Fiji. The years since the Weltkrieg have brought great change and hardship. The war strained both society and the economy, which in Australia manifested itself in the short-lived Melbourne Commune. Although disowned by the then-ruling Labor government and put down by demobilised Australian Imperial Force veterans, this resulted in the implementation of the Emergency Protocols, the suspension of elections, and the appointment of William Birdwood as Governor General. Then the British Revolution of 1925 shook the Empire to the core and Australasia was unable to prevent the loss of territories to the Germans. More than 10 years on, the situation is still unstable as the economy remains stagnant and domestic dissent continues to grow with Birdwood, alongside his ally Billy Hughes' Nationalist Party, barely holding things together."
austral.1.a:0 "Advance Australasia! Onwards!"
austral.2.t:0 "The Oncoming Election"
austral.2.d:0 "Elections in the Antipodes were suspended by the Emergency Protocols, enacted in 1923, which also led to the dissolving of the autonomy of the separate New Zealand Parliament. However, elections are now set for March this year after Stanley Bruce successfully campaigned for their reintroduction. Governor-General Birdwood was forced to make this concession when Bruce defeated Hughes for the leadership of the Nationalist Party. Bruce's decision not to act as unelected Prime Minister resulted in the expulsion of his faction from the Nationalist Party and Hughes' recall as PM, however the public would not accept the government reneging on its commitments. Australasia can ill afford a repeat of 1923 - as the spectre of Melbourne remains fresh in the minds of many."
austral.2.a:0 "We have to give way to change."
austral.3.t:0 "The Passing of King George V"
austral.3.d:0 "The ousted king of Britain, George V, has finally succumbed to the illness that had plagued him since revolution swept through the home isles. His son, Edward, has ascended the throne of the British Empire, including that of the Australasian dominions. While many in Australasia mourn, there are others for whom the king's death has resurrected memories of the Weltkrieg and the disaster of Gallipoli in particular, and they have taken to the streets to demand a separation of the nation from the British crown as well as the Entente alliance."
austral.3.a:0 "Can they not even respect a state of mourning?"
austral.4.t:0 "A Special Conference of the Labor Party"
austral.4.d:0 "Today the Australasian Labor Party convened a special session in Sydney where the former premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, was readmitted into the party after having been excluded for 5 years. Lang originally left the party and formed his own due to disagreements with the leadership. After his dismissal from government by the contemporary governor of NSW, Philip Game he fell out of popularity and sought to re-join the party. A powerful orator and a populist through and through, the re-admittance of Lang has caused consternation amongst the more leftist members of the Labor Party who, alongside the majority of trade union activists, see him more as a social feudalist inherently hostile to true socialist doctrine. It seems that the Australasian Labor Party is heading into a turbulent time, given the imminent election."
austral.4.a:0 "Let the leftists squabble amongst themselves!"
austral.5.t:0 "The Australasian Guard"
austral.5.d:0 "Originally formed in 1925, the Australasian Guard is a staunchly nationalist and jingoistic movement, which traces its roots back to the paramilitary organisation the 'League of National Security'. Comprised of former servicemen returning from the Weltkrieg with the backing of influential Australasians, many of these men helped put down the 1923 Melbourne Commune. In the years following the Melbourne Uprising, the Guard has continued to support the government, with many supporters joining the expanded security forces available to the Governor-General and assisting in suppressing left-wing activities. The coming return to democratic rule has caused an upset amongst the far right, however, who fear the re-emergence of the long-suppressed Labor movement and that the Nationalist Party, divided as it is, will be unable to maintain the status quo. Due to these factors, the Guard's leader, Eric Campbell, has decided that it will take part in the elections as the Centre Party. Despite their not-inconsiderable levels of popular support, at present it is unsure what impact they will have."
austral.5.a:0 "This can't be good..."
austral.6.t:0 "Victorian Bush Fires"
austral.6.d:0 "The state of Victoria has been hit by heavy bush fires in the north east and south west. Because of intense heat and drought over the last few years, much of rural Victoria has dried up - leaving plenty of fuel for the flames. The fires at this point are so incredibly intense that the ash and smoke can be seen from New Zealand. Firefighters with the aid of the state government are currently trying to combat the disaster, with the flames already threatening several major cities and causing considerable panic."
austral.6.a:0 "Goodness!"
austral.7.t:0 "Bush Fires Finally Extinguished"
austral.7.d:0 "The fires in Victoria have finally been extinguished, thanks to the efforts of local fire fighters as well as overdue dense rainfall. This victory has come at the cost of 71 lives, over 1000 homes destroyed, and the burning of almost 135,500 hectares of land. Currently Judge Leonard Stretton has been selected to lead a royal commission into what led to the disastrous fires, though many suspect farmers or graziers in rural areas to be responsible due to their long-standing practice of burning brush to clear new land."
austral.7.a:0 "Well, at least the worst is over."
austral.8.t:0 "Ion Idriess' 'The Cattle King'"
austral.8.d:0 "Leading Australian writer Ion Idriess today published his latest novel, 'The Cattle King'. It follows the life of recently-deceased Sir Sidney Kidman, an entrepreneur and pastoralist who owned or co-owned large areas of land in Australia in his lifetime. Kidman became widely popular due to his support of the government in the Weltkrieg and charitable organisations. The book looks set to be Australasia's best-seller for 1936, and many are drawing parallels between Kidman and the exiled White Rajah, Charles Vyner Brooke, which is sure to boost Brooke's popularity."
austral.8.a:0 "An Interesting Read!"
austral.9.t:0 "Australasia Day"
austral.9.d:0 "Today the nation is celebrating the Confederation of Australasia and, while the confederation was not voluntary - having been initially formed by the British invocation of the Conservation of Resources Act in 1924 - it still has brought many benefits to both Australia and New Zealand, or such is the common belief. Crowds are lining the city streets from one side of the country to the other in order to celebrate the occasion."
austral.9.a:0 "Advance Australasia Fair!"
austral.10.t:0 "The [GetYear] Federal Election"
austral.10.d:0 "The first free elections in over a decade, which many are calling 'Bruce's Election', look set to return a majority for the United Australasia Party. However, the Labor and Country parties are campaigning vigorously, while the Nationalists struggle to retain their core vote with the left voting UAP and the right declaring for the Guard's Centre Party. Many are, at least, grateful that Campbell's Centre party seemingly has no chance of actually winning, though it seems likely they will make a good showing."
austral.10.a:0 "Earle Page and the Country Party."
austral.10.b:0 "John Curtin and the Australasia Labor Party."
austral.10.c:0 "Stanley Bruce and the United Australasia Party."
austral.11.t:0 "The Australasian Guard and the Election"
austral.11.d:0 "The Australasian Guard has emerged from the election far stronger than when it went in. Eric Campbell's Centre Party, while failing to take many Parliamentary seats, did manage to secure a large percentage of the popular vote, mostly at the expense of the Nationalists. Despite this, the lack of a coherent strategy as well as a hostile media reception were clear hindrances for them."
austral.11.a:0 "Oh dear!"
austral.12.t:0 "A New Governor-General?"
austral.12.d:0 "William Birdwood's tenure as Governor-General saw a vast expansion in powers available to the position, which he used to maintain order in Oceania at the expense of democracy and civil liberties. Birdwood, a British General from the Weltkrieg, was imposed upon Australasia by an Empire fearful of revolt... but times have changed, and the newly-elected government could use this opportunity to replace him with a native Australasian, or replace him with the well-liked governor of New South Wales, Sir Alexander Hore-Ruthven. While this move would be popular with many, others have suggested that an opportunity exists to invite a member of the royal family to assume the role and thus put Australasia more firmly within the sphere of the Empire and our fellow Entente allies. Another suggestion for Governor-General is former White Rajah Charles Vyneer Brooke, who has been a famed socialiser in Sydney and has gotten the support of several far-right groups such as the Centre Party and New Guard Movements."
austral.12.a:0 "William Birdwood should remain where he is."
austral.12.b:0 "It is time for an Australasian Governor-General!"
austral.12.c:0 "We should invite a member of the royal family to hold the post."
austral.12.e:0 "Sir Alexander would make a fine Governor-General!"
austral.12.meme:0 "The White Rajah will bring us Stability and International Fame!"
austral.13.t:0 "The ACTU Makes its Move"
austral.13.d:0 "The Australasian Labor Party National Executive met today in Canberra, after being swept into office in an unexpected result. John Curtin now has to decide which direction to take the party and the nation, however. There is a schism already opening between the different wings of the party. Jack Lang and the moderate right wing of the party are up against the revolutionary left, consolidated around the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. The ACTU wants to seize this opportunity to enact real syndicalist policies throughout Australasia, form a republic in memory of the Melbourne Commune, and break from the imperialist Entente. Lang wishes to expel these radicals from the party, maintaining our place in the Empire. Curtin must make a choice: break his party or lead a revolution."
austral.13.a:0 "Expel the revolutionaries from the party!"
austral.13.b:0 "The ACTU seizes control! Declare the syndicalist republic!"
austral.14.t:0 "New Labor Campaigning"
austral.14.d:0 "There have been a recent upswing in the Labor party's campaign efforts, as they appear to have a great deal more money in the party coffers than previously thought possible. [Root.GetAdjective] police investigators suggest that the money is likely being funnelled through the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, sent by the Union of Britain, as an effort to support radicals within the Labor party... though there is no real evidence of that yet."
austral.14.a:0 "Foreign interference in our elections? Outrageous!"
austral.20.t:0 "Workers' Organisation and Trade Unions"
austral.20.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Melbourne Commune and the Revolution of 1925, trade unions were made illegal. While many continued to operate underground alongside the Australasian Labor Party, they were suppressed by the expanded police and military districts as well as by the Australasian Guard. While we may be sceptical of their ideology, the continued draconian enforcement of Birdwood's policies will undoubtedly be an unpopular move, so we must consider whether to legalise these unions and seek a compromise with their leaders."
austral.20.a:0 "Rescind Birdwood's policies."
austral.20.b:0 "Trade unions cause trouble - continue the suppression."
austral.21.t:0 "The Syndicalist March"
austral.21.d.notlabor:0 "Responding to the election results, which the Labor party claims were rigged against their candidates, radicals supported by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions held an illegal march in several of Australasia's cities today. They are protesting the continued suppression of unions, and several of the marches ended in clashes with both the police and local paramilitary groups. All the marches were successfully dispersed, but leaders have sworn that they will continue to resist the new government, and that without freedom the Australasian Confederation cannot truly call itself a democracy."
austral.21.d.labor:0 "Responding to their recent ejection from the Labor party's ranks and the new government, radicals supported by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions held an illegal march in several of Australasia's cities today. They are demanding a swift end to union suppression, something Labor party leaders have already promised, and several of the marches ended in clashes with both the police and local paramilitary groups. All the marches were successfully dispersed, but leaders have sworn that they will continue to resist the new government, and that without freedom the Australasian Confederation cannot truly call itself a democracy."
austral.21.a:0 "They are asking for trouble."
austral.22.t:0 "The ACTU Campaign"
austral.22.d:0 "Responding to the government's decision to legalise trade unions, the newly-legitimised ACTU has begun a major push for the next general election. Large crowds have been gathering to hear syndicalist leader Fred Paterson speak, and while pundits don't give the radicals much hope in winning there is a sense of worry regarding Paterson's growing support. Some ministers have expressed reservation of the legalisation, calling it a 'dangerous experiment', but for the moment the damage appears to be minimal."
austral.22.a:0 "We will keep a close eye on this."
austral.23.t:0 "Unions Protest Suppression"
austral.23.d:0 "Union supporters have taken to the streets in several major Australasian cities, protesting the government's decision to continue the suppression of the ACTU and its syndicalist allies. The protesters were met with police, and later with Australasian Guard paramilitary groups, and this led to bloody clashes in Melbourne where dozens were reported injured. Maximist leader J.B. Miles has called for continued resistance to the government's anti-union policies, although he drew short of openly calling for armed revolt."
austral.24.t:0 "Miners Clash with Police"
austral.24.d:0 "The continued suppression of trade unions drew a strong reaction today as miners across Victoria state attempted a walk-out, protesting unsafe conditions which have only become worse over the last decade. While they claimed to have no association with a union, their action was declared unlawful, and several clashes with police ended with the death of a miner by the name of Joseph Grenton. While the walk-out was disbanded, 'Miner Joe' has been elevated to something of a folk hero among the Australasian working class."
austral.24.a:0 "A dead folk hero, that is."
austral.25.t:0 "ACTU Celebrates Deal"
austral.25.d:0 "The new Workers' Deal enacted by the government has been a great cause for celebration among Australasia's working class - and the Australasian Council of Trade Unions specifically has led marches across several large cities to commemorate the historic occasion. Speeches by ACTU leaders drew massive crowds, where they spoke with obvious fervour about syndicalist ideals and the true interests of the working class. Police stood nearby, keeping back agitators who hurled slurs at the socialists, and there were no reports of incidents."
austral.25.a:0 "At least there was no violence."
austral.26.t:0 "Illegal Strike in Sydney"
austral.26.d:0 "Factory workers in Sydney walked off the job today, organising an illegal strike that prompted swift police reaction. While the workers insisted they were not associated with the ACTU and their action was borne of frustration, they were issued an ultimatum to disperse - which they ignored. Violence quickly escalated when the police moved in, and the resulting riot ended with over thirty badly injured. Within a week, the factory workers were back on the job... now supervised by private militia soldiers, to ensure no further demonstrations."
austral.26.a:0 "This is rather getting out of hand..."
austral.27.t:0 "Lang Speech Disrupted"
austral.27.d:0 "Jack Lang gave a fiery speech today in Sydney, in which he railed against the syndicalists and radicals which have plagued the labour movement. He did not get far into his speech, however, when it was disrupted by syndicalist supporters chanting 'Traitor' and 'Sell-out'. Lang at first ignored such taunts but eventually joined in, with every counter-insult he made being followed by cheers and roars from his supporters. When discussing employment Lang had decided to eject the Syndicalists after one remarked 'Didn't you and Beasley turn Australasian workers out of their jobs when you scabbed the party?'. Following this, a violent confrontation broke out between the Syndicalist and Labor supporters. The incident was picked up by the Australasian media, and while their intent was to blame the radicals for their disruption, instead it is Lang who is seen by the public as the one who escalated the confrontation and edged on his supporters."
austral.27.a:0 "Perhaps 'I will punch your bloody teeth in' was too much."
austral.28.t:0 "Paterson Gives Speech"
austral.28.d:0 "With the lifting of martial law across Australasia, crowds are once again able to assemble - a fact that syndicalist leader Fred Paterson took advantage of today in Sydney to give a speech that drew a very large crowd as well as media attention. Paterson spoke of the need for an 'open dialogue' between the unions and the government, and that there was no need to fear the brand of democracy that syndicalism brought. The speech was branded by some as the 'ramblings of a radical', though many others said that Paterson's well-spoken manner earned him many new supporters."
austral.28.a:0 "I see..."
austral.29.t:0 "Factory Burns in [factory_state.GetName]"
austral.29.d:0 "One of the largest factories in [factory_state.GetName] burned through the night in what is believed to be arson. The factory has reportedly had numerous complaints about working conditions and unfair pay, most of which have gone unaddressed over the last five years. The owners deny this and claimed this was yet another attempt by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions to stir up trouble and support for the syndicalist cause. While damage was severe, the ACTU has no claimed any responsibility for the fire and police are still investigating."
austral.29.a:0 "Sabotage, now?"
austral.30.t:0 "General Strike"
austral.30.d.legal:0 "The labour situation worsened in Australasia today as the ACTU called for general strikes around the country to protest the poor working conditions present in many factories. Some are calling this a ploy for support, and the move has already prompted many leaders within the Australasian Guard and elsewhere to call for the government to reverse its decision to allow labour unions, but either way the strikes are expected to go on for several weeks until some kind of compromise can be achieved."
austral.30.d.illegal:0 "The labour situation worsened in Australasia today as the ACTU called for illegal strikes around the country to protest poor working conditions and the continued suppression of unions. Some are calling this a ploy for support, and the move has already prompted many leaders within the Australasian Guard and elsewhere to call on the government to redouble its efforts to crush the radical movements behind the labour disruptions."
austral.30.a:0 "Oh my!"
austral.31.t:0 "Rise of the Australasian Guard"
austral.31.d:0 "In response to the general labour unrest which has been plaguing Australasia since the last election, Eric Campbell today made an impassioned speech calling for 'united, determined and firm action on the part of the loyal citizens of Australasia'. He says the government has failed in its mandate, and that unless severe measures are taken all of Australasia will succumb to chaos and the tide of syndicalism which is washing across the world. His words caught the attention of many, and already support in rural parts as well as the urban areas of the country has been shifting to his Centre Party."
austral.31.a:0 "That's all we need."
austral.32.t:0 "Rise of the AFM"
austral.32.d:0 "Up until this point, the Australasia First Movement - led by Percy Stephensen - has been considered a fringe movement filled with disaffected socialists. With the rise of chaos inspired by syndicalist forces, and with it the fortunes of the Australasian Guard, Stephensen's words have gained new purchase among the people of Australasia. Stephensen calls for Australasia to cut its ties with the British crown, to further promote Australasianism and to maintain a neutral stance in global affairs so to ensure Australasia never marches into another disaster like Gallipoli. 'They talk grandiloquently about 'filling up Australia's vast empty spaces' and then they dump down the scum of London here,' he tells his ardent supporters, 'To hell with the British and the Empire!'"
austral.32.a:0 "That's treasonous talk, is what that is."
austral.33.t:0 "AFM Protests the War"
austral.33.d:0 "The Australasia First Movement, a group that advocates neutrality and a cutting of ties with the British crown, has set up a number of protests across the country to call for Australasia's abandonment of the current war. Cries of 'Never Gallipoli!' were heard from the marchers, who suggest the British have dragged the country into war after war, and that it is time for it all to stop. The group's message has carried to the Australasian people quite well, and those still disaffected by the lingering wounds of the Weltkrieg are clearly listening."
austral.33.a:0 "They're a fringe group, nothing more."
austral.34.t:0 "Charles Vyner Brooke Backs the Guard"
austral.34.d:0 "The exiled 'White Rajah' of Sarawak and noted Sydney socialite, Charles Vyner Brooke, has now openly begun to associate with the reactionary group known as 'the Australasian Guard' led by Weltkrieg veteran Eric Campbell. Until now, the Guard has been a minor force in Australasian politics, but with their forceful revanchist rhetoric and populist flair the movement has begun to spread its influence beyond New South Wales, especially gaining support amongst discharged servicemen and disgruntled officers. With Brooke's charm and considerable monetary resources, the Guard might just have gained the staging point for a showdown with the new regime in Canberra. The government should be prepared for any eventuality."
austral.34.a:0 "This does not bode well..."
austral.35.t:0 "The Great Schism of the Australasian Labor Party"
austral.35.d.notlabor:0 "Since Jack Lang's re-admittance to its ranks, the Labor Party has been steaming with internal disputes. Today, Lang struck back at the leftist members of the New South Wales party branch, successfully having them excluded alongside their syndicalist-friendly trade union comrades from the ACTU. This purge of the NSW party has since rippled throughout the Confederation with Lang's supporters of moderate social populists and anti-syndicalist union supporters ostracizing and marginalising their more leftist opponents. This 'Great Schism' of the Australasian Labor Party has firmly separated the Oceanic worker's movement into a reformist and populist rump Labor Party and a revolutionary movement consolidating around the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. Yet all is not well in Labor, since friction still exists between Lang and the popular John J. Curtin."
austral.35.d.notlabor2:0 "Since Jack Lang's re-admittance to its ranks, the Labor Party has been steaming with internal disputes. Today, Lang struck out at Labor leader John J. Curtin, claiming Curtin has not gone far enough to deal with the radicals and that they will all but certainly plunge the country into chaos. This 'Great Schism' of the Australasian Labor Party has firmly separated the Oceanic worker's movement into a reformist and populist rump Labor Party, as well as the exiled revolutionary movement consolidated around the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. Yet all is not well in Labor, since friction still exists between Lang and the popular John J. Curtin."
austral.35.d.labor:0 "Since Jack Lang's re-admittance to its ranks, the Labor Party has been steaming with internal disputes even despite the ejection of the syndicalist radicals. Today, Lang struck out at Labor leader John J. Curtin, claiming Curtin has not gone far enough to deal with the radicals and that they will all but certainly plunge the country into chaos. This 'Great Schism' of the Australasian Labor Party has firmly separated the Oceanic worker's movement into a reformist rump Labor Party and a more populist group led by Lang himself - a faction which is called 'Lang Labor' by most. The move is all but certain to split the party's support going into the next election."
austral.35.a:0 "Interesting."
austral.36.t:0 "Scandal Rocks Government"
austral.36.d.uap:0 "To compound the UAP's increasing unpopularity with the people, the government has come under fire due to a corruption investigation which has made its way to the newspapers. While no senior ministers were implicated in the affair, the scandal has led to a sense among the Australasian public that the UAP government is both ineffective and riddled with men who are only out for their own enrichment. A series of arrests and a shuffling of minister positions appears to have made the scandal fade a bit, but the damage is done - and, going into the next election, it may be severe indeed."
austral.36.d.country:0 "To compound the Country Party's increasing unpopularity with the people, the government has come under fire due to a corruption investigation which has made its way to the newspapers.

austral.36.a:0 "That is terrible timing."
austral.37.t:0 "The Possibility of Coalition"
austral.37.d.uap:0 "With the UAP facing dwindling support going into the next election, several Country Party leaders have approached us and offered a possible solution: a coalition between UAP and Country, combining their efforts and support bases to ensure that neither the Labor Party nor any of the more radical upshots has a chance at achieving victory. This would mean admitting Country ministers into the cabinet, but some advisers suggest it may be our only route to victory."

austral.37.a:0 "A united front against radicals and Labor, how can we refuse?"
austral.37.b:0 "No - we will have enough support to form government."
austral.38.t:0 "The New Coalition"
austral.38.d:0 "Having lost the election and also seeing their conservative support eroding in the wake of the rise of both the Australasian Guard and the AFM, the UAP and Country Party have announced a coalition going into the next election. They will combine their efforts and form a join government should they win - and, according to many, their chances of doing so have increased tremendously. Already leaders Stanley Bruce and Earle Page have been touring the major cities in Australasia, greeting large crowds with joint appearances."
austral.38.a:0 "But will that be enough?"
austral.39.t:0 "'Forty Thousand Horsemen'"
austral.39.d:0 "Directed by Charles Chauvel, 'Forty Thousand Horsemen' tells the story of the Australian Light Horse during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the last Weltkrieg. It follows the adventures of three rowdy heroes in fighting and romance and culminates at the Battle of Beersheba. While the film is clearly a propaganda tool to aid in recruitment and lift the pride of Australasians at home, it is fast becoming the most successful Australasian film ever produced."
austral.39.a:0 "Wow!"
austral.40.t:0 "VFL Finals"
austral.40.d:0 "Extraordinary enthusiasm is building for the Victorian Football League grand finals, with large numbers of people having been recorded attending the trainings for both the Collingwood Football club and the South Melbourne Football Club. Despite the warm weather, the teams trained strenuously for the upcoming premiership on Saturday at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Both sides are confident they can take out the grand finals, but time will tell who will succeed."
austral.40.a:0 "Such excitement!"
austral.42.t:0 "Collingwood takes another Premiership"
austral.42.d:0 "Around 76,000 spectators today have witnessed the Collingwood Football Club achieve their 11th premiership. The 'Master Football Tacticians' were able to bait as well as exploit the movements of South Melbourne. That, coupled with the many fatal errors in South Australia's play, led to Collingwood taking the win by 11 points."
austral.42.a:0 "What a game!"
austral.43.t:0 "South Melbourne takes the Premiership"
austral.43.d:0 "Around 76,000 spectators witnessed an incredibly close game with the South Melbourne Football Club securing their 4th premiership. Despite the organisation and training of Collingwood, South Melbourne was able to see through the tricks laid out and avoided giving up unnecessary marks. South Melbourne consistently played a defence, but managed to score one last behind in the dying minutes of the game to secure a one-point victory."
austral.44.t:0 "Stanley Bruce and Joseph Lyons Attend Rally"
austral.44.d:0 "Coming off the recent decision to form a coalition between the UAP and the Australasian Country Party, leaders Stanley Bruce and Joseph Lyons today jointly attended a rally in Sydney where they warned against the rise of extremism in the nation, and suggested that turning away from those who had brought democracy back to Australasia would see the country plunged into more war and chaos and not less. The rally was well-attended, and their words brought cheers from the audience, though it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to see them through the coming election."
austral.44.a:0 "We shall see."
austral.50.t:0 "The [GetYear] Federal Election"
austral.50.d:0 "As per the Constitution of Australasia, elections are to be held at least once every three years (a legacy of Australian practice). This year's election is particularly important, due to the rise of Eric Campbell's Australasian Guard, which is running in the federal elections as the Centre Party, and Percy Stephensen's Australasia First Movement, both of which have siphoned support from the traditional conservative parties. Will the electorate stick with one of the established political parties, or will they opt instead for the radicals?"
austral.50.a:0 "Stanley Bruce and the United Australasia Party."
austral.50.b:0 "Earle Page and the Country Party."

austral.51.d:0 "Events in Australasia have reached boiling point, and paramilitary groups loyal to the Australasian Guard have stormed the capital! The coup is being led by Thomas Blamey along with Eric Campbell both heroes of the Weltkrieg. For the soldiers of the Military Districts stationed in Canberra, many of them also veterans of the Weltkrieg, a hard choice must be made: either turn their guns upon Heroes and their fellow soldiers or stand aside and allow him to overthrow the democratically-elected government of Australasia."

austral.52.d:0 "Today Eric Campbell and Thomas Blamey, both veterans of the Weltkrieg and perpetrators of the Australasian Guard's attempted coup d'état, were sentenced to life imprisonment by the High Court of Australasia for high treason. The leadership of the Guard and its political wing the Centre Party, shares the same fate along with many other prominent members. The Centre Party has been dissolved and the Australasian Guard more or less ended as a political force in Australasia. Charles Vyner Brooke unfortunately could not be linked directly to the coup and so escaped a prison sentence, although many accuse him of bribing those involved in his prosecution."

austral.60.t:0 "Considering the Maori Act"
austral.60.d:0 "The treatment of the native Maori peoples has been one of the sticking points in the administration of New Zealand under the confederation and the New Zealand government has been pressing the larger government for years now to pass an act incorporating the Treaty of Waitangi into Australasian law of which would guarantee the human and land rights of the Maori to their island of which is not shared by Aboriginals elsewhere in Australasia. Doing so would appease New Zealand, though would not be appreciated elsewhere in Australasia, but there are many in the government who suggest the unproductive Maori land could be put to far better use under government control."

austral.61.t:0 "An [Root.GetAdjective] Republic?"
austral.61.d:0 "Despite the fact that [Root.GetNameDef] is no longer a colony, officially it remains under the control of the British crown - the Governor-General is our head of state, and until the election in 1936 ruled the nation absolutely. Thus, a separation between our government and the crown can only truly be done with royal assent, even if we intend to remain good allies with [crown_country.GetNameDef] after our constitution is repatriated to [Root.GetAdjective] soil. Delegates have today been sent to [crown_country.GetNameDef] to formally make the request of our king, and we should hear his response soon."

austral.62.t:0 "An [From.GetAdjective] Republic?"
austral.62.d:0 "Representatives from [From.GetNameDef] arrived today for an audience with the king, formally requesting the repatriation of their constitution. This would, in effect, transform [From.GetNameDef] into a republic, cutting all but ceremonial ties to the British crown. They say they fully intend to remain loyal allies to [Root.GetNameDef], and this is technically within their rights to proclaim, though there are some who suggest this is treasonous talk even so - until the 1936 election they were under the direct rule of their Governor-General according to emergency measures, and before that a British colony. Who are they to declare themselves a republic? [From.GetNameDef] would be nothing were it not for the support of the British crown!"

The [Root.GetAdjective] Prime Minister is now our head of state as well as the head of the government, with the Governor-General's duties being purely ceremonial, and all decision-making power remaining within [Root.GetNameDef]. While we remain [From.GetNameDef]'s staunch ally, never again will we be subject to their control as we were following the invocation of the Emergency Protocols in 1925.

austral.64.t:0 "The Crown Severs Ties"
austral.64.d:0 "While the crown has given its assent to repatriate the [Root.GetAdjective] constitution, they have also ejected us from the British alliance, stating that any colony so willing to abandon the empire cannot expect its protection nor be expected to come to its aid. Some [Root.GetAdjective] politicians felt this response to be almost childish, but the matter is done - never again will we be subject to British control as we were following the invocation of the Emergency Protocols in 1925.

austral.65.t:0 "The Crown Refuses"
austral.65.d:0 "In what has become a shock to many within the [Root.GetAdjective] government, our delegates have returned with word that the British crown has refused our independence. [Root.GetNameDef] plays too vital a role within the Entente, they were told, and is too integral a part of the British Empire. Considering that, until recently, [Root.GetNameDef] was under the crown's direct rule, the attitude is perhaps not unexpected. The option still remains to declare the republic anyhow, though doing so could elicit a reaction from [From.GetNameDef] to retake a 'rebellious colony'."

After this point, his role will be purely ceremonial, and the [Root.GetAdjective] head of state will also be its head of government. We are, now and forever more, a truly independent republic!"

austral.68.d:0 "As part of our nation's drawing closer to the royal crown, a new Governor General has been appointed for us - Prince Henry, the Duke of Gloucester, brother to the king and an accomplished man in his own right.

austral.80.t:0 "Massive Demonstrations"
austral.80.d:0 "In response to the Australasian Guard's assumption of control, control which has come with the suspension of democratic rule, demonstrations have broken out across [Root.GetNameDef]. The government suspects that much of this is orchestrated by syndicalist activists in the Australasian Trade Council Union, but that cannot currently be proven... and, truth be told, support for the syndicalist rhetoric is increasing rapidly.

Several paramilitary groups, ardent supporters of the Australasian Guard government, descended on the strikers and violently ended it in a clash that left over 25 dead and 60 wounded. While further strikes appear to be unlikely, the government is largely seen as responsible for the bloodshed and it appears to only be a matter of time before activists take up their calls once again."

austral.84.d:0 "After a period of quiet, protests have erupted across [Root.GetNameDef] this week - massive marches of thousands, with the crowd in Sydney alone estimated to reach upwards of a hundred thousand people. This is far too much for the [Root.GetAdjective] to disperse without sparking a civil war, and thus so far, they have primarily sought to contain things. These are the first protests where syndicalist leader John Curtin has spoken openly, demanding the Australasian Guard government resign in disgrace, and though police have attempted to quietly arrest Curtin so far the crowds have protected him."

This intervention does signal at least a return to the previous status quo, and it appears the resignation of the Australasian Guard government has been enough to take the wind out of the uprising.

austral.110.t:0 "Massive Demonstrations"
austral.110.d:0 "In response to the assumption of government control by the Australasian Trade Council Union, massive demonstrations have broken out across [Root.GetNameDef]. The government suspects that much of this has been orchestrated by right-wing radicals, including members of the so-called Australasian Guard, all of whom are slavishly opposed to any kind of syndicalist rule.

austral.111.d:0 "While the ACTU prepares for its first congress, one that will determine the future direction of a syndicalist Australasia, there is much positioning behind the scenes for the election of a temporary chairman. The holder of that role will, in effect, have control over the government's day-to-day running... more so, in fact, than the Prime Minister. The moderate syndicalists support the well know Fred Paterson for the position, though J.B. Miles has been gaining a great deal of steam with his calculated speeches and rhetoric."

Currently there are two long standing comrades that are worth of such a position. The first is Lance Sharkey, who has had a long-standing relationship with Miles and is unshakeable in his orthodox beliefs. The other is the previous leader of the party, Herbert Moxon, who has many years of experience behind him and is one of the syndicalists responsible for the infiltration of the Australasian Labor Party which enabled the revolution. Both are worthy, but only one can be chosen."
austral.112.a:0 "Lance Sharkey will make a fine vice-chairman."
austral.112.b:0 "Herbert Moxon has earned the position with his experience."
austral.113.t:0 "The Syndicalist Vice-Chairmanship"
austral.113.d:0 "Following the success of the syndicalists in the recent congress, Fred Paterson has now the honour of choosing the first vice-chairman of Australasia to run the government's day-to-day operations. Jack Henry is quite familiar with Paterson, as both were notorious for organising illegal strikes and further expanding syndicalist membership during the early 30's in Queensland, which took on the nickname of 'the Red North'. The other viable contender is well-known philosopher John Anderson, who seeks to reform the education system and provide higher institutes of learning for his fellow comrades."

austral.130.t:0 "Massive Demonstrations"

The government suspects that much of this has been orchestrated by right-wing radicals, including members of the so-called Australasian Guard. These monarchistic tykes, all of whom are slavishly devoted to the British, would do anything to bring the nation back under their protective umbrella.

austral.132.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] Republic has distanced itself from the British and now seeks closer trade and diplomatic ties with powers closer to home, or so say the envoys they recently sent to the [Root.GetAdjective] government.

austral.135.t:0 "Aid for [PRF.GetNameDef]?"
austral.135.d:0 "With the [PRF.GetAdjective] government under siege, the idea has arisen that perhaps we should send aid... at the very least to prevent the syndicalists and British forces from gaining supremacy in the Indian sub-continent once again."

austral.136.a:0 "Hurrah for the Australasians!"
austral.137.t:0 "Appointing a Deputy"
austral.137.d:0 "With the AFM currently having wrested control over parliament, effectively turning the country into a dictatorship, there is a great deal of strife within the party over whether this is truly the right thing to do. Many have begun to question Percy Stephensen's leadership, and advisers have suggested that he might consider appointing a deputy who would exert more effective sway over the running of the government. The aboriginal civil rights activist Jack Patten would be an obvious and effective choice, though many have expressed a preference for the suffragette Adela Pankhurst - both because she is influential as well as because she is seen as more politically acceptable."
austral.137.a:0 "Stephensen will attempt to maintain control on his own."
austral.137.b:0 "Patten steps up to dutifully aid his Prime Minister."
austral.137.c:0 "Pankhurst is the most obvious choice."
austral.138.t:0 "Deportation of Undesirables"
austral.138.d:0 "Today many political prisoners, mainly composed of syndicalists and other 'troublemakers', have been shipped out of the nation as Eric Campbell promised in his 14 Points speech. Where these people are going is largely unknown, however it was noted there was not enough food or water supplies provided for all of the prisoners on their ships, and while questions have been raised as to exactly which countries have agreed to accept these political exiles they have largely been silenced by the government."
austral.138.a:0 "Australasia is better off without them."
austral.160.t:0 "Australasian Guard Prepares for Confrontation"
austral.160.d:0 "The government has received word of large movements of Australasian Guard supporters - many of them headed towards New Zealand, where their paramilitary forces have set up temporary bases under the command of Field Marshal Thomas Blamey. While we do not know their plans, we have no intention to wait for these radicals to act. So far, over a hundred Guard supporters have been rounded up throughout [Root.GetNameDef], including members of the Centre Party and their leader, Eric Campbell. Campbell was resistant to the last, but to no avail, and was hanged during a live radio broadcast as an example to any sympathisers. Whether this will dissuade the Australasian Guard, however, remains to be seen."

austral.352.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government, pursuing a revanchist policy which it calls the Blamey Doctrine, has laid a claim on the southern Pacific Islands, citing that they were only lost due to Germany's assumption of control following the Weltkrieg, and that they are part of [From.GetNameDef]'s eminent domain."
austral.353.t:0 "Australasia Claims the [Root.GetAdjective] East Indies"
austral.353.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government, pursuing a revanchist policy which it calls the Blamey Doctrine, has laid a claim on the islands north of New Guinea - all of which were once part of the Spanish East Indies and sold to Germany following Spain's lost in their war with the United States. [From.GetNameDefCap] has declared [Root.GetNameDef]'s control over the region to be contrary to its national interest."
austral.354.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Claims Singapore"
austral.354.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government, pursuing a revanchist policy which it calls the Blamey Doctrine, has laid a claim on Singapore - the last bastion of the United Kingdom as it held out against Germany in the final days of the Weltkrieg.

austral.355.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Claims Northern Borneo"
austral.355.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government, pursuing a revanchist policy which it calls the Blamey Doctrine, has laid a claim on northern Borneo - no doubt at the prompting of the White Rajah, the man who used to run the kingdom of Sarawak as his own personal playground and would like to see it restored."

austral.356.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government, pursuing a revanchist policy which it calls the Blamey Doctrine, has laid a claim on the Malay peninsula, citing that it was taken from the British following the end of the Weltkrieg and thus is properly part of [From.GetNameDef]'s eminent domain."

austral.357.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government, pursuing a revanchist policy which it calls the Blamey Doctrine, has laid a claim on the western part of the island of New Guinea. While they cite that the region is integral to their security needs, truly they have no claim to it and this is merely further evidence of their expansionist, imperialistic policies."

austral.358.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government, pursuing a revanchist policy which it calls the Blamey Doctrine, has laid a claim on the island of Timor.

austral.360.b:0 "What? No! They will have to fight for it."
austral.361.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Gives Away our Land"
austral.361.d:0 "Our [From.GetAdjective] overlords have agreed to a demand from [AST.GetNameDef] that the lands they claim under their revanchist Blamey Doctrine mandate be turned over immediately. Apparently, they fear [Ast.GetNameDef] will back up their demands with war?"
austral.361.a:0 "It seems we have no choice in the matter..."
austral.362.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Relented"
austral.362.d:0 "It appears luck is with us - [From.GetNameDef] has relented to our demands and agreed to turn over our claims at once. War will be unnecessary."

austral.364.d:0 "With [Root.GetAdjective] forces occupied in our current war, and none present in New Guinea, [From.GetAdjective] troops have crossed the border and seized the territory. There appears to be little we can do about it, at the moment."

austral.367.t:0 "Returning British Lands"
austral.367.d:0 "Now that the Home Lands have been restored, it is time we consider what to do with the lands taken via the Blamey Doctrine - they are, after all, lands we recovered for the sake of the British, while they were unable to do so on their own. It's possible they might simply let us keep it all. We did all the work, after all. Some in our cabinet are suggesting that [Root.GetNameDef] shouldn't make the offer. Australasian soldiers did shed blood for it, did we not?"
austral.367.a:0 "We should offer it back."
austral.367.b:0 "No - we will protect it better than they did."
austral.368.t:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] Offer"
austral.368.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has contacted us with an offer - now that we have been restored, the lands they took in our name through the Blamey Doctrine are rightfully ours to take back, so they say. Considering that [From.GetNameDef] expended a great deal of blood and effort to get them, however, perhaps it's worth recognising that they offer more protection for these colonies than we could ever provide?"
austral.368.a:0 "We will gladly accept their offer."
austral.368.b:0 "They fought for it, they can keep it."
austral.369.t:0 "The Lands are Returned"
austral.369.d:0 "With hearty thanks, the [From.GetAdjective] government has accepted the return of their former colonies.

austral.369.a:0 "Well done, us!"
austral.370.t:0 "We are to Keep the Colonies"
austral.370.d:0 "With a heart thanks for the offer, the [From.GetAdjective] government has declined to take the colonies back. [Root.GetNameDefCap], they say, can clearly offer better protection for these lands than they ever could, and they trust we will administer them as they would."
austral.370.a:0 "Oh? That's nice of them to say."
austral.1000.t:0 "An Australasian Empire?"
austral.1000.d:0 "Britain has fallen to the Syndicalist Barbarians. We Australasians citing the historical Eastern Roman Empire, Are all that remains of decent Britannia. The old Dynasty, of the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who have brought us to ruin in the Weltkrieg, will likewise bring ruin to Canada. Under the leadership of the White Rajah, and the grace of God almightly, Australasia shall see a thousand-year Empire... for we have divine providence and exceptionalism is our trademark." 
austral.1000.a:0 "Australasia shall rise from the ashes!"
austral.1000.b:0 "Now is not the time for Granduer." 
austral.1001.t:0 "The Dream of an Australasian Arcadia"
austral.1001.d:0 "‘All the unhallowed beauty I have found; All free, discordant shrills and form-defying wonders above ground, like writhen trees with draggled foliage struggling along the courses of wayback creeks; scarlet- and- green sky-streaking parrot-fires with parrot shrieks echo-shattering the shoulders of the hills; and desert-sunset-rage Rage for my mind, be clamant, do not cease you are my holiest habitat of peace.’ \n\nThese flowing and vibrant words penned by Reginald ‘Rex’ Ingamells perfectly encapsulate the main ideas of the budding movement that has taken Australasia by storm. Called the Jindyworobak Movement - taking its name from the Woiwurrung word meaning ‘to join’, and founded by Rex Ingamells with few other close artists, poets, and theorists - most notable of which is AFM founder P. R. Stephensen, this group holds a near-utopian idealist attitude towards the natural environment of Australasia, and sees this ideal most exemplified by the Aborigines of Australia that have long been masters of the Bush, well informed on its natural phenomena. Though no indigenous peoples make up their numbers, which are primarily composed of White Australians aligned with the AFM and other nationalist groups, the members of the movement hold deep respect for their connection to nature, and seek to emulate that connection within wider Australasian society. \n\nPursuing a romantic, uniquely-Australasian pastoral utopian culture based on the archaic Arcadian idyll and rooted in naturalism, nationalism, and environmentalism, the Jindyworobak movement has seen increasing popularity in recent times as more and more Australasians become disillusioned with the Entente and the wider interconnected Anglo identity. With these ‘Jindys’ influencing our people more and more, Australasia is in good hands as we all join in to strive to create our own identity way out here at the edge of the world."
austral.1001.a:0 "The pastoralist ideal can be achieved here if we work for it."
austral.1002.t:0 "Australasia First!..."
austral.1002.d:0 "The AFM under Percy Stephensen has long espoused nationalist sentiments and an emphasis on a ‘Australasia First’ ideal. However, beneath the surface, the AFM holds deep sympathies to a certain other growing nationalist power out here in the Pacific: the Empire of Japan. \n\nSeeing Japan as both a kindred spirit and a natural ally, Stephensen has used his magazine ‘The Publicist’ as a mouthpiece for years spreading fervently pro-Japanese and anti-Syndicalist rhetoric. The AFM has long sought to emulate much of Japan’s success, and now as we endeavor to forge our own destiny away from our former allies and overlords in the Entente, Stephensen has increasingly drawn further inspiration from their corporate economy and populist, nationalist policies. What this fascination with the Empire of the Rising Sun will do for our nation, we can not say just yet, but for now, Stephensen’s infatuation with the Showa Emperor’s domain has been largely harmless."
austral.1002.a:0 "...but Japan second."
austral.1003.t:0 "A Honorable Retirement"
austral.1003.d:0 "With his term coming to an end, beginning in 1931 as the capstone to an already long and fulfilling career, Governor-General Isaac Isaacs has decided to end his illustrious métier at the ripe age of 80, retiring to his manor in Victoria. Beginning his professional journey as a lawyer and later MP, Isaacs has come to dedicate his entire life in service to both the people of Australasia and the Crown. With his retirement, the presumptive successor to his position is likely to be the 1st Earl of Gowrie, The Right Honourable Alexander Hore-Ruthven, though this decision has not been conclusively decided nor announced publicly at this moment. Regardless, the nation readies itself for its new Governor-General as they wave goodbye to Sir Isaac Isaacs. Despite his old age, some can’t help but to feel as though their hallowed leader has left them in a time of great struggle, as many feel a coming squall brewing on the horizon. Regardless, the Australasian people soldier onwards, everready for approaching storms."
austral.1003.a:0 "A true Australasian patriot."
