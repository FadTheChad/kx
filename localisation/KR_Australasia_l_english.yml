### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_HENRY_WINDSOR_DESC_AST: "Prince Henry of Windsor, elder brother of the deceased Prince George, has been appointed Governor-General of Australasia. Though regarded as an extremely nervous child, Henry grew into an active and modest man. While Australasians appreciate Henry's virtue, the expectation among many in its government was that appointment to the post of Governor-General would be restored to the discretion of the Australasian parliament. Regardless of the disappointment of some, however, Henry is well liked. With the country still mourning from such a tragic air-crash, Henry toils diligently to ensure that Australasia is properly governed."
POLITICS_ALBERT_WINDSOR_DESC_AST: "Prince Albert of Windsor, elder brother of the deceased Prince George, has been appointed Governor-General of Australasia. Though ridiculed as a child for his noticeable stammer, Albert grew into a collected and dutiful man. While Australasians appreciate Albert's virtue, the expectation among many in its government was that appointment to the post of Governor-General would be restored to the discretion of the Australasian parliament. Regardless of the disappointment of some, however, Albert is well liked. With the country still mourning from such tragic air-crash, Albert toils diligently to ensure that Australasia is properly governed."
POLITICS_EDWARD_WINDSOR_DESC_AST: "The eldest son of the late King George V, Prince Edward hoped to be the standard bearer for the reclamation of his beloved Britain; a fate that would never come to be, as circumstances caused his fall from grace and eventual abdication from the throne of the land he loved so much. Forced to accept the conciliatory prize of Governor-General of Australia due to the tragic death of his brother, Edward toils diligently to ensure that Australasia is properly governed, despite the fact that Edward was seemingly only granted the post to get him out of the way of Canadian affairs... and because everyone else was either busy somewhere else, or dead."

### Ideas ###
AST_oversized_fleet:0 "Oversized Fleet"
AST_oversized_fleet_desc:0 "In the chaotic aftermath of Britain's downfall, many ships fled to Australasia to find refuge - far more than could be maintained in the country's meagre ports. Even with many ships mothballed (4 battleships, 2 armoured cruisers, and almost 50 smaller ships), it still is too much for Australia to handle. A solution needs to be found."
AST_upgrading_reserve:0 "Upgrading Naval Reserve"
AST_depression_1:0 "Economic Depression"
AST_depression_1_desc:0 "Australasia's economy was never particularly strong, and the aftermath of the Weltkrieg has only made it much, much worse.

AST_anzac_spirit_1:0 "ANZAC Spirit"
AST_anzac_spirit_1_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the Australian and New Zealanders were the most aggressive, and managed to keep their form in spite of their questionable discipline.

AST_upgrade_facilities:0 "Legacy of John Jellicoe's report"

AST_pacific_navy:0 "A Navy for the Pacific"

### Decisions ###
AST_anderson_policy_decisions:0 "Blamey Doctrine"
AST_anderson_policy_decisions_desc:0 "The Blamey Doctrine sets out that the former colonies belonging to the United Kingdom, lost after their collapse at the end for the Weltkrieg, are rightfully [Root.GetAdjective] domain. In the name of our national security, it is vital that we get these colonies back and expand our dominion over the islands of Southeast Asia and the Pacific."
AST_exploit_resources:0 "Exploit Resources"
AST_claim_new_guinea:0 "Claim New Guinea"
AST_claim_new_guinea_desc:0 "Port Moresby and the surrounding territory in New Guinea is a vital outpost for our nation, and our security will always be threatened so long as the northern portion of New Guinea as well as the island chain directly to its east are under the control of enemy nations."
AST_claim_melanesia:0 "Claim Melanesian Islands"
AST_claim_melanesia_desc:0 "The islands of Melanesia - including New Caledonia, New Hebrides, the Solomon Islands, and Nauru - were only lost to France and the United Kingdom following their defeat at the end of the Weltkrieg. Under the Blamey Doctrine, they are properly part of our eminent domain, and belong under our protection."
AST_claim_south_pacific:0 "Claim the Southern Pacific"
AST_claim_south_pacific_desc:0 "There are a number of islands chains in the southern Pacific Ocean - including the Gilbert and Ellis Islands, Samoa, Polynesia, and Pitcairn Island - that were once British possessions, but which were seized by Germany after the British collapse following the Weltkrieg. Under the Blamey Doctrine, they are properly part of our eminent domain, and belong under our protection."
AST_claim_caroline_islands:0 "Claim the German East Indies"
AST_claim_caroline_islands_desc:0 "The various island atolls that lie to the north of New Guinea - among them the Marshall Islands, the Caroline Islands, Palau, and the Marianas - were sold by Spain to Germany following the end of the Spanish-American War at the turn of the century. Their presence off our northern coasts is a threat to our national security, and the islands properly belong under our protection."
AST_claim_singapore:0 "Claim Singapore"
AST_claim_singapore_desc:0 "Singapore was once the colonial bastion of the United Kingdom in Southeast Asia, the last holdout in the Weltkrieg before the Admirality had to abandon it for Australasia. Gaining it back is the central tenet of the Blamey Doctrine, and vital to building our national security."
AST_claim_sarawak:0 "Claim Sarawak"
AST_claim_sarawak_desc:0 "The region of northern Borneo was once known as Sarawak, a British holding under the White Rajah himself. With the White Rajah and his family having fled to Australasia, there is considerable internal pressure on the government to extend the Blamey Doctrine to this region and bring it back under our domain as a protectorate."
AST_claim_malaya:0 "Claim Malaya"
AST_claim_malaya_desc:0 "The Malaysian peninsula is not only a region that contains vital resources, it is also a former British territory taken by the Germans following the Weltkrieg. While gaining it might be extending our reach further north than is wise, it falls within the jurisdiction of the Blamey Doctrine that former British territories in Southeast Asia are part of our eminent domain, and thus we should seek its return."
AST_claim_western_new_guinea:0 "Claim Western New Guinea"
AST_claim_western_new_guinea_desc:0 "While the western part of New Guinea is not covered under the Blamey Doctrine, having never been held by the British, it is nevertheless vital to our national security, as the islands lie immediately off our borders and we cannot tolerate it remaining within possibly enemy hands."
AST_claim_timor:0 "Claim Timor"
AST_claim_timor_desc:0 "While the island of Timor is not covered under the Blamey Doctrine, having never been held by the British, it is nevertheless vital to our national security, as the islands lie immediately off our borders and we cannot tolerate it remaining within possibly enemy hands."
AST_demand_claimed_territory:0 "Demand Claimed [From.GetAdjective] Lands"
AST_demand_claimed_territory_desc:0 "The time has come to send an ultimatum to [From.GetNameDef] - either they turn over the lands we have rightfully claimed under the mandate of the Blamey Doctrine, or it will be war."
AST_seize_new_guinea:0 "Seize New Guinea"
AST_seize_new_guinea_desc:0 "With the rulers of the northern part of New Guinea crumbling in their current war, and no troops sitting on our border, the time is ripe to walk in and seize the territory before they can do a thing."
AST_seize_western_new_guinea:0 "Seize Western New Guinea"
AST_seize_western_new_guinea_desc:0 "With the rulers of the western part of New Guinea crumbling in their current war, and no troops sitting on our border, the time is ripe to walk in and seize the territory before they can do a thing."

The [From.GetAdjective] market has been resistant to these efforts in the past, and the distance is a difficult obstacle to overcome, but new destinations for [Root.GetAdjective] goods are sorely needed."

AST_restore_order_nzl:0 "Restore Order in New Zealand"
AST_restore_order_nzl_desc:0 "The time has come to restore law and order in New Zealand, and to remind the locals that they are - now and forever more - an integral part of [Root.GetNameDef], indivisible from the rest of the nation."
AST_conscription_plebiscite:0 "Begin the Conscription Plebiscite"
AST_conscription_plebiscite_desc:0 "The enactment of conscription laws will be an unpopular move, one that will be accompanied by cries of 'Remember Gallipoli!' throughout the country. Yet we have dire need to expand our army's enrolment. The best way to move forward would be to hold a national plebiscite on the issue. If it passes, we will have the mandate we need without fear of mass reprisal."
AST_skip_plebiscite:0 "Force Conscription"
AST_skip_plebiscite_desc:0 "There is no time to hold a plebiscite on conscription, as has been suggested in the past. It must be enacted, whether the people like it or not, and our government will simply have to bear the consequences."
AST_force_conscription:0 "Force Conscription"

AST_hold_out_vs_entente_desc:0 "Defeating the entire Entente is unlikely, but if we can hold out against their forces long enough we can perhaps force them to peace talks. If we hold New Zealand at that time, they may even have no choice but to let us keep it."
