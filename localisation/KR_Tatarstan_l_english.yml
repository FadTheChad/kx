### Focuses ###
  
TTR_Khan_In_Kazan: "The Khan in Kazan"
TTR_Khan_In_Kazan_desc: "The new Khan Shafi has entered the Kazan Kremlin and secured his position as the new Khan. Now, our noble khanate shall rise from the pages of history under Khan Shafi who shall be the herald of our coming destiny. Glory and prosperity await us, if we only just reach for it!"

TTR_Reassure_Nobility: "Reassure the Nobility"
TTR_Reassure_Nobility_desc: "To solidify our powerbase and ensure the stability of our regime, we will need the support of the local nobility. The local Tatar noble class that has long dominated local politics shall be given far-reaching privileges and rights over their fellow man, if and only if they serve the new Khan."

TTR_All_Tatar_Kurultai: "An All-Tatar Kurultai"
TTR_All_Tatar_Kurultai_desc: "Our ancestors, the mighty and fearsome Mongols, and their descendants all relied on the organization structure of the Kurultai, or councils of khans and chiefs, to rule and administer their vast empires. This model of governance served our kin well, and so it shall serve us! A new council shall be formed, the All-Tatar Kurultai, and it will serve as the new legislative body of our khanate. However, to ensure that it is loyal to our whims and the true needs of the people, it shall still be completely under control of Khan."

TTR_Form_Darugas: "Revive the Darughas"
TTR_Form_Darugas_desc: "Darughas were the archaic territorial subdivisions of the old Mongol Empire and its children states such as our ancestors in the medieval-era Kazan Khanate. Each of these regions was lorded over by a certain hereditary feudal chief or khan as its master. We shall revive and modernize this system to fit our needs, subdividing our new khanate under loyal nobles, generals, holymen, and other prominent figures in the Kurultai. This sort of neo-feudalism shall become the new foundation for our state’s administrative apparatus, returning us to tradition as we strive towards our new future."

TTR_Purge_Unfaithful: "Purge the Unfaithful"
TTR_Purge_Unfaithful_desc: "Jews, Christians, Secularist, and other vile heretics and infidels plot against our state at every turn. These foolish zanādiqa must be turned towards the glorious and pure light of Islam and Mohammed, truly accepting Allah into their hearts, lest they face our divine wrath and have to choose either the sword or the end of a barrel."

TTR_Khan_Guards: "The New Kheshig"
TTR_Khan_Guards_desc: "In order to safeguard our most prominent national figures as well as to serve as the vanguard of our armed forces, the Mongolic guard of old - the Kheshig - shall be revived and modernized to fit the needs of our state. These special divisions of Khan Guards will be extensively trained and indoctrinated with the tenets of our Khan, steeling their resolve and preparing them for their life-long duty to protect Khan and the Khanate"

TTR_Islamic_Order: "Islamic Order"
TTR_Islamic_Order_desc: "There is but one true faith on this Earth, and its prophet is Mohammed! The influence of Islam in Tataria must be made to reign supreme over these lands, and so the state has enacted a plan to fully Islamicize Tataria, cleansing it of the influence of the Secularism and Orthodoxy. New mosques and temples shall be built across the nation, with many serving as either schools for our youth or as shelters and clinics for the poor and downtrodden. Imams will be given sweeping powers and authority over much of the state’s lower functions, and more men of the clergy shall be allowed into the Kurultai. Tataria shall be a land truly blessed by Allah’s touch."

TTR_Army_Of_Nomads: "An Army of Nomads"
TTR_Army_Of_Nomads_desc: "We are the heirs to the Mongols and the Golden Horde. Our ancestors were great nomads who swiftly rode across Eurasia on their thundering steeds and created some of the largest empires in history. We must hold true to this identity and incorporate their strategies into our army tactics, with modernization of course. Our armed forces shall be flexible and able to strike like lightning anywhere within our domain, for we are the sons of Batu and Ghengis, and we shall not sully their names."

TTR_Zilant_Awakens: "Zilant Awakens"
TTR_Zilant_Awakens_desc: "Zilant, or Ajdaha, is the legendary serpent-like dragon which is said to have lived centuries ago in Kazan, with many old shamans and mystics of Idel-Ural still believed that any snake that lives past a century shall turn into such a majestic beast. Described as a serpentine, dragon or wyvern-like beast with the body shape of a massive bird of prey, the legs of a rooster, the tail of snake, and the ears of a wolf, with crimson wings and dagger-like teeth, and adorned with dark grey and black scales and feathers, this beast of legend has long been a ferocious symbol of our nation, being depicted on the Khanate flag and displayed in most public settings as a symbol of Tataria and our strength. Like this long-slumbering beast, our khanate is a sleeping giant, ready to burst forth and slay the vermin that have assailed the lands of our birthright."

TTR_Expand_Into_Muscovy: "Revenge Against the Old Duchy of Muscovy"
TTR_Expand_Into_Muscovy_desc: "With the foundations of our new regime cemented and the rule of Khan Shafi solidified, it is now time to take the fight from the enemies within our border to the parasitic foes that leech over our rightful lands. The lands around Moscow are ours by birthright, and we shall tear these fertile heartlands from the putrid Sons of Rus, for the era of Russian domination is at an end - the era of Tataria has just begun."

TTR_Our_Rightful_Claims: "Altin Urda Shall Rise Again!"
TTR_Our_Rightful_Claims_desc: "We are the one, true heirs to Batu Khan, unifier of the various warring feudal states that arose between Temüjin’s sons and grandson in the wake of his death, and father of the Golden Horde. His lands now languish under foreign scoundrels and Slavic fools, taunting us with every misstep. We shall ride into these rightful lands of Tataria and raise the banner of our khanate high over each and every city that once was graced with our ancestor’s rule."

TTR_Tatar_Republican_Army: "The Tatar National Army"
TTR_Tatar_Republican_Army_desc: "To defend our new state from the wrathful forces that surround us, we will need a modern, well-equipped, and sufficiently-trained army.

TTR_Subordinate_The_Legion: "Subordinate the Legion"
TTR_Subordinate_The_Legion_desc: "The Legion is getting stronger each day and these paramilitaries do not listen to anyone, but their command. If we are to build a modern state, only the government shall have monopoly on power and use of force. We must subordinate the Legion to the Härbi Shura, our Military Council."

TTR_Lessons_Of_CW: "Lessons of the Civil War"
TTR_Lessons_Of_CW_desc: "The Russian Civil War was one of the bloodiest conflicts of the modern era, costing the lives of millions to a foolish conflict over ideology that only caused more problems for these lands. However, if we learned one thing from that hell, it was how to effectively wage war in this new, rapidly evolving era we find ourselves in. From the carcasses and chaos of that fratricide, we shall learn everything we can about doctrine and strategy, better preparing us for the next war."

TTR_Increase_Military_Spending: "Rampant Military Spending"
TTR_Increase_Military_Spending_desc: "Our hungry and growing military industry needs more capital if it is to sufficiently expand to fit the needs and ambitions of our khanate. All excess investment and free capital shall be poured into the business of war, for we will need all we can amass for the coming maelstrom."

TTR_Mass_Mobilization: "Mass Mobilization"
TTR_Mass_Mobilization_desc: "We need manpower, and we need it desperately if we are to ever hold a chance against the Russian wave. Every able-bodied man must be taught to hold and fire a rifle, how to clean his kit, and how to ride a horse, among other basics of Tatarian warfare, so that if and when the time comes that their Khan calls on them to serve their nation and their countrymen, we can all rest-assured that they at least know how to shoot a gun."

TTR_Create_National_Doctrine: "Create a National Doctrine"
TTR_Create_National_Doctrine_desc: "A grand, unified military doctrine of all of our theorems, strategies, tactics, and more must be compiled, organized, and disseminated throughout our nation’s armed forces. With this, we shall become masters of war, moving in sync and cohesion with one another as we all follow the same set plans, as well as ensuring the longevity of these ideas so that we may teach it and evolve it to fit the needs of generations to come."

TTR_Smuggle_The_Weapons: "Smuggle More Weapons"
TTR_Smuggle_The_Weapons_desc: "Every man in Tataria needs to be able to draw a rifle and defend his nation and his countrymen at any moment, but we lack the industrial base to actually achieve this ideal. Instead, we shall resort to back-alley channels and black market ties to source new weapons of war, for Tataria and her peoples will be free, no matter the cost."

TTR_Train_The_Officers: "Mandated Training Regimes"
TTR_Train_The_Officers_desc: "The officers and the men of our armed forces and militias must be trained and drilled around the clock to ensure their readiness for the coming crusade. They will be pushed to the brink and farther, for if they are true sons of the Mongols, they can surely take it."

TTR_Patriotism: "Bolster Tatarian Patriotism"
TTR_Patriotism_desc: "A unified, flourishing Tatarian identity must be cultivated within our khanate, and our people must be made to love our Khan and his regime over all other states and entities. True patriots put their nation and their countrymen above all else, and this ideal shall be ingrained in every citizen, for patriotism and national pride are among the highest virtues in life."

TTR_Military_Industrial_Complex: "Tatar Military-Industrial Complex"
TTR_Military_Industrial_Complex_desc: "To further build up the state’s military might and industrial base, the government and our largest manufacturers shall begin to work more closely together, directly feeding into the needs of the other as they accelerate towards rampant, unbridled progress and industrialization in the pursuit of ever-higher ambitions. Unquenchable but productive, this new system shall greatly benefit the military and wider industrial base of our nation, but also further beholden the Kurultai to the military."

TTR_Office_School: "A Tatar Officer School"
TTR_Office_School_desc: "A new officer class must be created, entirely composed of loyal, dedicated Tatar nationalists in order to ensure the utmost level of security within our military hierarchy. These new leaders shall be the liaisons between the masses of the armed forces and the Kurultai and the new leaders of our military. With them, the future of our khanate and the success of our armies rest." 

TTR_Conquer_Land: "A New Tatar Hegemony"
TTR_Conquer_Land_desc: "We shall extend our rule and stretch the confines of our sphere of influence until we are the true masters of this realm.

Our khanate shall stretch from the Black Sea to the Altai Mountains, and all between shall be under our total command!"

TTR_Airforce: "The Tatar Republican Air Force"
TTR_Airforce_desc: "Though we have long been masters of the ground, as expert riders and soldiers, the domain above has long eluded us, until now. A new air force shall be created so that we may tame the skies and achieve supremacy against our various foes both in the air and on the ground. With this approach, they will have nowhere to run."

TTR_Construct_Bases: "Construct New Bases"
TTR_Construct_Bases_desc: "New air bases, aerodromes, and runways, hangars, and other aeronautic infrastructure must be constructed across our lands to be able to accommodate our new and growing air force.

TTR_National_Air_Academy: "The National Air Academy"

TTR_Pursue_Fighter_Development: "Pursue Fighter Development"
TTR_Pursue_Fighter_Development_desc: "Fighters are the warhorses of the sky, like the horses that carried our ancestors across Eurasia. Able to strike like lightning and control the skies, we should invest in these designs so that we may make our own aluminum steeds as we strive to tear across the skies like streaking comets and dominate the heavens."

TTR_Pursue_Bomber_Development: "Pursue Bomber Development"
TTR_Pursue_Bomber_Development_desc: "Bombers are the mighty oxen of aviation, soaring high over the clouds and carrying large, deadly payloads able to bring ruin to our enemies from afar.

TTR_Conquer_Sky_desc: "The heavens are ours and the abyss over Tartaria are clear, save for the black clouds of swarming planes patrolling the air. Like the Mongols tamed the Steppe, we too have claimed a great and wild expanse, and all of Tataria is secure under these machine-filled skies."

### Events ###
ttr.1.t: "The Failed Idel-Ural State"
ttr.1.d: "Following the contours of territorial autonomy that began to emerge in the aftermath of the February Revolution, the political activism of the Tatar community also gained momentum. Their flagship project was the vision of the Idel-Ural State, an aspiring federal entity within Russia that aimed to unify the Turkic-Tatar population of interior Russia and secure access to the shores of the Caspian Sea.\n\nIn order to implement this project of autonomy, the Millät Mäjlese (National Assembly) was established — the national assembly of the Turkic-Tatar Muslims of Inner Russia and Siberia, founded by the decision of the Second All-Russian Muslim Congress.\n\nHowever, the proclamation of the state, scheduled for March 1st, 1918, was thwarted by the leadership of the Kazan Soviet, which established the Kazan Soviet Republic under the leadership of Bolshevik Yakub Sheinkman, close Yakov Sverdlov. Power was transferred to the Bolsheviks, and Sadri Maksudov, the president of the failed Idel-Ural State, left Russia.\n\nAlready in June 1918, the political landscape shifted dramatically. On the 8th of June, the government of the Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly, commonly known as Komuch, was established in Samara. This development forced the Bolshevik forces to focus their attention on the Volga region, where they engaged in a confrontation against both internal opposition groups and the Czechoslovak Legion. By the summer of that year, the situation in Kazan had reached a critical stage due to Komuch's offensive operations. The significance of Kazan further intensified due to its status as a location housing the majority of the gold reserves belonging to the Russian Empire, making it a strategic target for both sides. The sole combat-ready units of the Red Army stationed in Kazan consisted of the 5th Zemgale Latvian Regiment, the 1st Muslim Socialist Regiment, and the 1st Tatar-Bashkir Battalion. On August 6, these units were unable to maintain their positions against the advancing forces. Additionally, members of underground officer organizations provided support to the advancing troops.\n\nOn August 7, 1918 Kazan and its province fell under the control of Komuch. The City Duma in Kazan was reinstated, and the City Council once again assumed its executive role. Representatives from the right-wing and center factions of the Duma commenced their activities. Local governing bodies were transformed into quarterly committees, engaged in unselective searches and arrests, targeting not only supporters of the Soviet regime but also their perceived adversaries. The fragility of power in the city was further exacerbated by the simultaneous operations of multiple counterintelligence organizations. The conflicts between military and civil authorities, as well as between businessmen and workers, accompanied by indiscriminate gunfire, resulted in instability within the government and growing dissatisfaction with the Komch regime, particularly among the working class. On September 3rd, in response to the arrest of delegates from a non-partisan workers' conference, an uprising erupted among workers, centered around the powder factory. The rebels aimed to seize control of Zarechye and the Krasnaya Gorka railway station, breach the front lines, and establish contact with Red Army units. However, due to the intervention of military forces, the uprising was swiftly suppressed, with its leaders facing execution.\n\nBut with the uprising of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, the assassination of Vladimir Lenin and the seizure of gold reserves by Komuch troops, the days of the Bolsheviks were already numbered. All power in Russia soon found itself in the hands of white forces, including in the whole of Tatarstan."

ttr.2.t: "Tatarstan in 1936"
ttr.2.d: "Even before the cessation of hostilities, at the behest of the all-Russian government under Kolchak, the existence of all national autonomies was abolished. Many representatives of indigenous peoples were compelled to emigrate and never return, including Sadri Maksudi Arsal, the former president of Idel-Ural.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the civil conflict, at a second Constituent Assembly, the national and cultural self-determination of the peoples was recognized. However, in contrast to the Alash and Turkestan autonomies, power in Kazan and Ufa remained, so to speak, in the hands of the central government. In theory, Tatars were granted all the rights afforded by national and cultural autonomy. Nonetheless, local governance remained vested in local Dumas and municipal councils, much like under the rule of Komuch.\n\nThe aspirations of the Tatars for sovereignty or, at the very least, territorial autonomy were not fulfilled, but neither were they forgotten. In the wake of the revolutionaries regaining power in central Russia and the onset of a new civil war, Sadri Maksudi Arsal has arrived in Kazan from the Ottoman Empire. In Kazan Gubenia itself, local militias under the leadership of Gabdrakhman Galiullin and Ahmet Timer are actively organizing, proclaiming the establishment of the Tatar Legion. However, it is important to acknowledge the influence of left-leaning forces that continue to hold power, such as the Milli Shura, which maintains close cooperation with revolutionaries in Moscow and Petrograd."
ttr.2.a: "Tatarstan - super good!"

ttr.3.t: "The Legions Liberate Tataria!"
ttr.3.d: "Almost as soon as the formation of the Red Guard in Kazan under the aegis of the Milli Shura commenced, a response began — a long-simmering counter-revolutionary and nationalistic movement. It all commenced with a radio broadcast on behalf of Gabdrakhman Galiullin, better known in certain circles by his pseudonym Shafi Almas. He was a businessman who owned his own shops in Moscow, Orenburg, and Kazan prior to the revolution. During the Civil War, he tried to fight for the establishment of the Volga–Ural State but fled to Turkey when Kazan fell to the Bolshevik onslaught. In recent years, due to the crisis in the Ottoman Empire, Galiullin returned to Russia in the hope of trying his luck there — and an opportunity presented itself.\n\nThus, on the behest of this obscure entrepreneur, the establishment of the Tatar legions was proclaimed, intended to safeguard order and resist any attempts by the Muslim Socialist Committee and the Red Guards to impose revolution on Tatarstan. The slogans of independent Idel-Ural are actively propagated within this new movement, with recruits predominantly comprised of youth and students seeking retribution for the suppressed freedom of Tatars.\n\nWhile this movement remains in its nascent stages, its impact is already palpable, as legions have been established in all major urban centers of the region, and Gabiyullin has announced the formation of a coordinating body for the legionary cause."

ttr.4.t: "Sadri Maksudi Returns From [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
ttr.4.d: "As soon as news spread that power in Petrograd had been transferred to the workers and the revolutionary government, Sadri Maksud Arsal, professor of history of law and philosophy at [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] University, submitted his resignation and departed for Kazan.\n\nThis esteemed professor, who had completed his studies at the Sorbonne, had arrived in the city incognito just last week, but today, he made an official appearance on the podium in Kazan. Of course, his identity was quickly revealed — Sadri Maksudi is a well-known figure in the Muslim scholarly community, particularly among the Tatars, where he is revered as the first president of the Idel-Ural Republic, albeit one that never achieved full statehood. He was welcomed by Ilyas Alkin, who also said that Maksudi will take his seat in the Milli Idarä"
ttr.4.a: "Tatarstan will be free."

ttr.5.t: "Ilyas Alkin's Sudden Presidency"
ttr.5.d: "The first to respond to the revolutionary rhetoric in Petrograd unquestionably was Ilyas Alkin. A member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the newly elected mayor of Kazan, he was a hereditary political figure, the son of Seyid-Giray Alkin, deputy of the First State Duma and a prominent figure in the formation of the Tatar autonomous movement. As one of the organizers of the first All-Russian Muslim Congress in Moscow in May 1917, Seyid-Giray delivered a speech on the principles of cultural and national self-determination. After the Revolution, he withdrew from political life and devoted himself to reforms in the legal system of Kazan province, serving as a people's judge until his passing in 1929.\n\nBut let us return to Ilyas, the veteran of the Weltkrieg, who became a prominent figure in the aftermath of the February Revolution. In 1917, he assumed the position of Chairman of the Provisional All-Russian Military Council for Muslims, advocating for the autonomy of Muslim communities in Inner Russia and Siberia. He also served as the head of the Finance Department for Idel-Ural State and was elected as a representative from Kazan province to the First Constitutional Assembly.\n\nFollowing the failure of the autonomy movement, Ilyas was forced to flee Kazan, only to be apprehended by Kolchak forces in Yekaterinburg. However, his release was facilitated by the intervention of the Czechoslovak Legion, leading to his subsequent employment as Chief of Staff for the Bashkir Army. Upon the dissolution of this unit, he once again fell into the hands of the White Guard, who incarcerated him in Moscow on charges of separatism.\n\nFollowing his amnesty after the convening of the Second Constituent Assembly, Ilyas Alkin embarked on a career as a professor at the Moscow Commercial Institute. There, he rose to the position of head of the Department of Economics and Geography for the foreign East. However, fate intervened, leading him back into the realm of politics. In 1933, he contested the elections for the Kazan City Duma, aiming to secure the post of City Head (Gorodskoy Golova) from the ranks of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. His aspirations were met with success, securing his position as the duly elected leader of Kazan."

ttr.6.t: "Red Guards in Kazan"
ttr.6.d: "Within a mere few hours of the proclamation of the revolution in Petrograd, spontaneous formations of Red Guard units commenced in Kazan, operating independently and unaccountable to any authority save for the similarly spontaneously established soviets of working-class and peasant representatives. These disorganized elements even engaged in sporadic acts of plunder, but once the Milli Shura emerged, these disparate bands found a new source of direction.\n\nNonetheless, we cannot condone such a state of affairs within the military hierarchy. The Milli Idarä has had enough of the undisciplined Tatar Legion, even if it is more organized than before, for it remains unaccountable to the central authority. Our allies in the Milli Shura insist that, under their supervision, the Red Guard would maintain allegiance to the government; however, the leadership appears to be uneasy about this prospect.\n\nWe must address the issue of disbanding these revolutionary units immediately and incorporating all volunteers willing to join the newly established national army of the Republic, under the strict supervision of Härbi Shura. This, however, is likely to strain our relations with our socialist allies.\n\nAlternatively, if we permit Milli Shura to continue assembling the Red Guard, we may gain their support and strength to counteract the Tatar Legion."

ttr.9.t: "The National Board"
ttr.9.d: "As Russia descended into a fresh spiral of chaos, revolution, and civil war, Kazan embarked on a whirlwind of power consolidation. The Kazan City Council, under the leadership of Ilyas Alkin, the newly elected city head of Kazan, declared the seizure of power and proclaimed the independence of the Tatar Republic.\n\nHowever, the aspirations of one city could not represent the aspirations of all Tatars. As Legionnaires seized control in the provinces of Tatarstan, the infant republic required robust support and a legitimate administration. In response, Alkin initiated the establishment of two institutions: the National Board (Milli Idarä), serving as an interim government until free and fair elections could be held, and the Military Council (Härbi Shura) tasked with reinstating Tatar regiments, establishing a national army, and assuming control over paramilitary units.\n\nWhile the Milli Idarä comprised delegates from diverse political factions, yet Alkin, a member of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, advocated for the Socialists to secure a majority in this council. While we don't have full power yet, we can already implement some reforms."
ttr.9.a: "We must get ready for free and fair elections."


ttr.10.t: "The Härbi Shura"
ttr.10.d: "On March 28, 1917, the Kazan Muslim Military Council considered the report of Ilyas Alkin with a proposal to create a Tatar Military District in the inner provinces of Russia, in which Muslim soldiers (not only Tatars) would serve in all its territories. At the suggestion of Ilyas Alkin, the congress unanimously adopted a resolution on the creation of Muslim military units. To coordinate this work, a Temporary Muslim Military Council (Harbi-Shuro) of 12 people is already being created throughout the country. The Muslim military units were to become, among other things, a guarantee of the realization of the right of the Muslim peoples to their self-determination.\n\nThe "Whites" in the civil war firmly stood on the positions of the unitary state and with all their might opposed the self-determination of the peoples of Russia. At the same time, the Military Council was sharply anti-Soviet and Harbi-Shuro was eventually liquidated by order of the Council of People's Commissars.\n\nHowever, with the entry of Tatarstan into the Russian Republic as an autonomy, the military forces of the republic were not restored, and the territory came under the full control of the federal Russian Army.\n\nIt is time to remember that we still have power over our land, to restore the Military Council, consisting of Tatars!"

ttr.20.t: "Ayaz Ishaki's Public Readings"
ttr.20.d: "Another prominent figure from the Tatar Renaissance literary movement and an active participant in political events from 1905 to 1918, Ayaz Iskhaki, has recently returned from exile. This man played a pivotal role during the tumultuous period of the First Russian Revolution. He actively engaged in the nationalist movement, organizing the secret Shakird society and serving as the leader of an illegal political organization for Tatar youth in Kazan known as 'Horriyat'. He also led the Tatar SR group of Tangists and represented the interests of young Tatar radicals at congresses of the Ittifaq al-Muslimin, a party of Russian Muslims. His activism earned him 18 arrests and periods of exile. This remarkable individual, a true champion for the freedom of his people, was compelled to seek refuge abroad after Russia quashed the aspirations of the Tatars.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Idel-Ural state and the dissolution of national autonomies by Kolchak's government, Ishaki relocated to Berlin, and then to the Ottoman Empire. In [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] he delivered lectures on the persecution of Islam in Russia, including the closure of mosques and harassment of clergy under the guise of secularism. Additionally, he traveled to several countries in the East, such as Egypt, Persia, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Morocco. Over the past three years, he has also visited countries in the Far East. During his travels, he engaged in various initiatives aimed at unifying the Turkic-speaking Tatars residing in the Qing Empire, the League of the Eight Provinces, Fengtian Manchuria and Japan. He also convened a congress in Shenyang, which was attended by Turko-Tatar Muslim communities from the Far East.\n\nUpon the declaration of the Tatar Republic, Ayaz Iskhaki, having returned from Japan, joined the ranks of Milli Idarä in Kazan, where he engaged in public readings of his own works and dedicated considerable attention to Ğabdulla Tuqay, our national poet."

Despite the fact that many delegates insist on the immediate nationalization of all Russian companies, their future fate does not find unity in opinions. Some, mainly the conservative wing of Ittifaq, propose to privatize these companies, distributing them to rich Tatar merchants and burghers. At the same time, the liberal wing of Ittifac insists that nationalization itself does not make sense and will only generate hatred towards us from the Russian governments, and will practically mean our death. \n\nIn addition, this issue became one of the only ones on which the opinions of socialists and nationalists converged. Both are in favor of the immediate nationalization of Russian enterprises. Moreover, the most radical delegates express the position that it is necessary to nationalize any enterprises on the territory of Tatarstan in general."

It is surprising that this issue is on the agenda at all, given that its solution does not make any sense at all in the conditions of a civil war and the greatest benefit can be obtained from cooperation with any of the governments. However, this issue has caused one of the fiercest disputes among the delegates. The Muslim Socialist Committee, as expected, demanded the immediate recognition of Soviet Russia as the only popular and legitimate government. His coalition partners, the ERK party, although they expressed support for the least reactionary forces, stated that it is necessary to recognize any government that guarantees the independence of Tatarstan. Ittifaq called for the recognition of the only legitimate government - the democratic republic, whose existence is generally under huge question. The nationalists demanded recognition of the Far East and Siberia in the hope of guaranteeing Tatarstan's independence."

The situation escalated sharply, and the assembled delegates demanded that the Assembly building be immediately vacated, to which the Socialists responded with warning shots in the air.\n\n It became obvious that the Socialists tried to seize power in the republic. Soon, a large rally gathered on the central square near the Kazan Kremlin, where Soltangaliyev made a speech about the inaction of the Government and the inability to make decent decisions when the country needs them urgently. On the other hand, the legionnaires from the nationalist battalions demanded the immediate dispersal of the rally, and their leader, Ahmet Timer, turned to the volunteer police and military detachments for help. Having learned about the clashes between socialists and nationalists, the MSK decided to take advantage of the situation by announcing the immediate formation of workers' committees and peasant councils and the recognition of the Provisional Government as invalid, and announced the creation of the Kazan Soviet Republic."

On the other side there is Panturkist ERK party, led by Ibragimov, who seeks the restoration of Idel-Ural state and subsequent union with Alash and Turkestan.\n\nThe debates on who should lead the revolutionary Tatars was always active, with both sides arguing that they are the best.

Divisions of the Bashkir National Army and detachments of Tatar Legionaries approached the building where the congress was held, and a scuffle broke out between them. To get out of this situation, it is necessary to find a compromise, otherwise there is a risk that the country will fall into a state of civil war.\n\nThe leader of the Tatar Legionaries, Ahmet Timer, recalled the divisions to preserve peace and security, and Galimyan Tagan, the leader of the Bashkir Military Council, followed suit. It seems that the parties began to listen to each other and look for compromises, when suddenly it became known that the leader of I-UTMAB Shafi Almas declared the illegitimacy of the congress and, together with his loyal legionnaires, went to storm the Kazan Kremlin"

Local councils of peasants’ deputies, workers’ councils, factory committees and other forms of civic self-organisation flourished, and socialist views predominated in them.\n\nLast week, congresses of Tatar councils were held both in Kazan and Ufa, the latter still under the control of Russian Red Guards. These congresses decided to establish a National Council (Milli Shura) aimed at uniting all Tatar peasants and workers. However, the council has not yet formulated its position on the revolution.\n\nIt is worth noting that in Ufa the left SR Ğälimcan Ibrahimov gained the upper hand, albeit not openly. Throughout the years, he remained an unacknowledged representative of the Tatar Left SR movement, which strongly supports the Revolution and the Soviet government in Petrograd.\n\nIn Kazan, the supporters of Ilyas Alkin triumphed under the guidance of his long-time comrade, Ğalimcan Shäräf. This faction is closely aligned with the right SRs, who thus far have not supported any of the purported Russian “governments”, but rather aim to assert their influence within the Tatar Republic.\n\nWhile Milli Shura may appear to be a unified entity, the majority within it is currently dominated by Kazan socialists. And Ufa, which is not under the control of Ibrahimov, is embroiled in a struggle that could divert his attention away from the situation for an extended period."

tatsoc.2.d: "Despite the apparent consolidation of socialist forces under the banner of Milli Shura, there remain those who refuse to be part of this movement. In Kazan today, a congress of the resurgent Muslim Socialist Committee took place, featuring none other than Mirsäyet Soltanğäliev — a fugitive Bolshevik who has clearly returned from his exile within the French Commune.\n\nTo the Tatar people, Soltanğäliev is primarily remembered as a Bolshevik, the mastermind behind the Kazan revolution, and an ardent opponent of the Idel-Ural State, whose efforts arguably contributed significantly to the failure of our nascent nation. To many, he represents a traitor, one who ultimately undermined the national aspirations of the Tatar people.\n\nNonetheless, during his years of exile, Soltanğäliev also gained notoriety for his ideological stance as an advocate of Islamic Marxist socialism. He actively opposed the preservation of Tatarstan as an autonomous region, advocating for the overthrow of the Russian government, which had extinguished the hopes of the Turko-Tatar people for genuine independence and equality with Russia.\n\nThis stance rendered him an outcast within the European socialist movement, being rejected both by his former Bolshevik comrades and the current authorities in Petrograd. However, among the Tatar community, there remains a belief in Soltanğäliev's vision, which challenges collective Europe and Western colonial Marxism that purports to liberate all peoples. Perhaps, his ideas on the independence of a socialist East will continue to resonate."

Our relationship with the Bashkir leader, [BKN.GetLeader], cannot be described as friendly or even cooperative, as their nationalism confronts our own desire for unity of all Turko-Tatars.\n\nIn light of the impending defense of Ufa, the local branch of Milli Shuro, led by Ğälimcan Ibrahimov, has sought assistance. However, they lack a majority in the city Soviet, with Bashkirs and their party, Irek, effectively holding the reins of power through the bayonets of the Red Guard forces.\n\nOn the one hand, should we lend assistance to Ibrahimov, it would undoubtedly garner the support of the Tatar community in the Ufa region, potentially allowing us to counter the influence of Bashkir nationalist elements within Ufa. However, it is crucial to note that the city remains under the jurisdiction of Russian authorities, and such an alliance may be met with disapproval by various political factions within the Tatar Republic, potentially even legitimizing the Petrograd Government, which remains a source of contention for us. The time has come to make a decision regarding the future of Ufa, one that may well impact the collective destiny of the entire Tatar nation."

Due to their harsh anti-socialist rhetoric, the representatives of the Ufa Milli Shura fled the city and relocated to Kazan.\n\nDespite the loss of major support base, Ibrahimov delivered a fiery speech in Kazan, criticizing the government and announcing his withdrawal from the Milli Shura. He accused the government of abandoning millions of Tatars in the Ufa region to their fate by not supporting the Milli Shura's efforts in Ufa.\n\nHis speech garnered significant attention and support from those seeking the unification of the Tatar people. In response to these developments, Ibrahimov declared that the Tatar Left SR Party rejects Milli Idarä and Milli Shura, forming a coalition with the Muslim Socialist Committee to oppose the current government."

Due to their harsh anti-socialist rhetoric, the representatives of the Ufa Milli Shura fled the city and relocated to Kazan.\n\nDespite the loss of major support base, Ibrahimov delivered a fiery speech in Kazan, criticizing the Bashkir government, and in hope to gain support from the Kazan population.\n\nHis speech garnered significant attention and support from those seeking the unification of the Tatar people."

tatsoc.6.d: "Following a prolonged siege of Ufa, the Bashkir nationalists withdrew, unable to assert control over the city. The city is celebrating its victory, with the Ufa branch of Milli Shura and its leader, Ğälimcan Ibrahimov, garnering substantial support among the Tatar populace, significantly contributing to this triumph.\n\nBut it played a cunning trick on us. On the meeting in Ufa, Ibrahimov leveled a scathing accusation against our government for failing to provide assistance to the Tatar community in Ufa. He declared the severing of all ties with the Milli Shura and the Milli Idarä and pledged unwavering support for the Petrograd administration."

# Ufa wins - support for Ibrahimov
tatsoc.7.d: "Following a prolonged siege of Ufa, the Bashkir nationalists withdrew, unable to assert control over the city. The city is celebrating its victory, with the Ufa branch of Milli Shura and its leader, Ğälimcan Ibrahimov, garnering substantial support among the Tatar populace, significantly contributing to this triumph.\n\nWhile the struggle for dominance in Ufa continues, it is clear that Ğälimcan's ambitions for dominating the city have been thwarted. The triumph in Ufa has further bolstered the position of the Ufa faction of Milli Shura, although they still fall short of achieving full influence not only within the Tatar Republic but also within the city itself. Nevertheless, the recognition of the authority of the Petrograd government is gaining increasing momentum."

tatsoc.8.t: "Tatar Milli Idarä Supports Ufa Defenders!"
tatsoc.8.d: "We have received information that the government of [TTR.GetName] has extended its support to the local Tatar community in Ufa, specifically represented by Ğälimcan Ibrahimov, a member of the Ufa Soviet and a supporter of the Tatar socialist revolutionary movement. Despite the fact that the Tatar socialists do not currently hold a majority position in the Soviet, and power is currently concentrated in the hands of Bashkir socialists, this act of support serves as a clear indication of the ambitious aspirations of the Tatar government, particularly in relation to their territorial claims in our ancestral homeland."
tatsoc.8.a: "They are traitors of their own people!"

tatsoc.9.t: "Fractured Allegiance of the Red Guards"
tatsoc.9.d: "The paramilitary arm of the Milli Shura — the Red Guard — has proven to be less steadfast in its ideological commitment to either the government or the leadership of Ğalimcan Shäräf. Due to the increasing influence of Muskom's and Soltanğäliev's propaganda, many members of the Red Guard are openly or covertly aligning themselves with the latter's call for revolution.\n\nIn the absence of political commissars to weed out disloyal elements and hold them accountable, the influence of Soltanğäliev and the Muskom is on the rise, posing a growing threat to our government. The effects of this growing influence must be taken into consideration as they continue to spread."
tatsoc.9.a: "A sad development."

tatsoc.10.t: "Clashes Between Tatars and Bashkirs"
tatsoc.10.d.intro: "Although it may appear that both Tatars and Bashkirs have chosen to take secessionist measures by distancing themselves from Russia, such an interpretation is a significant oversimplification of the situation. Within the Tatar-Bashkir socialist movement, there exists a profound division between those who support the Revolution and those who advocate for secession from Russia.\n\nWhile Tatar nationalists currently hold sway in Kazan, and Bashkir nationalists dominate the Southern Urals, Ufa witnesses a genuine conflict, despite our dominance over the city."
tatsoc.10.d: "$tatsoc.10.d.intro$ With a narrow majority of votes, the Ufa Soviet was able to chose Sharif Manatov, a popular socialist in Ufa, as its chairman. However, due to the fact that the majority of the region's population are Tatars, they do not welcome the leadership of a Bashkir nationalist. And Manatov's loyalty to our government also leaves much to be desired.$tatsoc.10.d.end$"
tatsoc.10.d2: "$tatsoc.10.d.intro$ With a narrow majority of votes, the Ufa Soviet was able to chose Shahit Hozaybirzin, a Bolshevik loyal to the government, as chairman. However, despite the fact that most of the Gubernia's population is Tatar, he is not particularly popular among either Tatars or Bashkirs.$tatsoc.10.d.end$"
tatsoc.10.d.end: "\n\nThe main opposition to Hozaybirzin's leadership comes from the Tatar Left SRs, who are our trusted allies led by Galimyan Ibragimov. The Left SRs in government advocate for the immediate transfer of power in the Ufa Gubernia to Ibragimov, which would allow him to annex Ufa to the Tatar republic. This move would give him significant advantages in his struggle for power and potentially lead to a successful revolution in Kazan. However, representatives from other parties argue that while Ibragimov can be trusted, there is no guarantee of his success in Kazan."
tatsoc.10.a: "Cheat - the SRs should have power in Ufa."
tatsoc.10.b: "We will crush Kazan nationalists first!"

tatsoc.11.t: "Simonov Rifles and Soviet Rubles"
tatsoc.11.d: "According to our intelligence reports, the Left SR forces are preparing a coup... Our troops are insufficient to secure all borders, moreover, the borders are not recognized, and we are almost completely surrounded by the Petrograd authorities and their Red Army, who periodically launch raids on vulnerable villages. It is therefore not surprising that poaching and illicit arms trafficking are thriving in the republic, and Soviet agents are infiltrating our cities.\n\nIt has come to our attention that the Central Committee of the Tatar Left SR party has recently received several million rubles from the Petrograd authorities, as well as multiple trucks laden with Simonov rifles. There is every indication that Ibrahimov is planning a revolution, but who will implement it, and more importantly, who is backing him, remains unclear.\n\nCertain of our advisors advocate for exerting pressure on the Milli Shura in order to intensify agitation among the working class and peasantry in support of our government. Conversely, a more radical faction of advisors maintains that Shäräf and the socialists should be kept under surveillance."
tatsoc.11.a: "Pressure Milli Shura."
tatsoc.11.b: "Reinforce our allies in Milli Shura."

tatsoc.12.t: "Kazan Soviet Workers'-Peasants' Republic"
tatsoc.12.d: "In January 1918, the Kazan Soviet of Workers', Peasants' and Soldiers' Deputies decided to take decisive measures to combat our national aspirations. In order to counteract the establishment of the Idel-Ural State, the Kazan Soviet resolved to convene a congress of Soviets of the Volga region and the Urals. However, the Congress adopted a resolution regarding the self-determination of the region's peoples in the form of a Volga-Ural Soviet republic.\n\nUndaunted by the decision of this congress, which they themselves had convened, the Kazan Soviet proceeded to establish the Kazan Soviet Workers'-Peasants' Republic, defying the very principles of self-determination. Following the agreement of the constituent parties, state structures for the republic were established, with Yakov Sheinkman elected as the chair of the Council of People's Commissars, despite his non-Tatar ethnicity.\n\nFollowing the promulgation of the regulations pertaining to the Tatar–Bashkir Soviet Socialist Republic in the month of March 1918, and a ban on the operations of all-Muslim organisations, Kazan Soviet Republic ceased to be relevant. The leaders of the Kazan Soviet failed to comprehend the fundamental principles of Russian governance and rejected the concept of federalism, instead seeking to replace the vision of the Idel–Ural state with a non-national idea — the Kazan Soviet Workers'-Peasants' Republic, which remained purely on paper.\n\nOn May 16th, 1918, the Kazan Soviet Republic officially ceased to exist through a decision made by the Executive Committee of the Kazan Gubernia Soviet due to "no soviet authority had declared the establishment of such a republic". Its powers were then transferred to the Kazan Soviet. Finally, after the liberation of Kazan by the People's Army of the Komuch, Yakov Sheinkman, a prominent figure, met his demise."

ttr_idu.3.d: "Despite the fact that the Tatar nation, thanks to the efforts of the Tatar Legion, managed to liberate a portion of our ancestral land from the revolutionary forces of Russia, not all ethnic groups were so fortunate. The situation for our Chuvash brethren is far from ideal.\n\nAlmost from the moment of the uprising in Petrograd, the Left SRs, led by the Chuvash Left Socialist Committee, and their prominent figures such as Daniil Elmen and Timakhvi Khuri, assumed control in Cheboksary, the largest city of the Chuvash people. These traitors to the national cause swiftly acknowledged the authority in Petrograd, leaving the Chuvash people seemingly doomed.\n\nDespite this, there are still patriots and true heroes among the Chuvash. One such individual is Fyodor Paymuk, a 35 year old merchant, who served in the Russian Army and graduated from the Industrial and Economic Institute. In recent years he published a newspaper 'For National Freedom', and he actively sought to achieve greater autonomy for the Chuvash people, but his efforts were in vain.\n\nHowever, with the emergence of the Tatar Legion, these hopes may not be so far-fetched. Fyodor immediately joined the Legion as a volunteer, and the Legionary leadership recognized him as a true champion of Idel-Ural's freedom. Akhmet Timer has officially appointed Fyodor as the Consul of Chuvashia within the Legion, acknowledging him as the official voice of the Chuvash community."
ttr_idu.3.a: "All peoples of Idel-Ural will be liberated."

ttr_idu.4.t: "Society for the Study of the Local Region"
ttr_idu.4.d: "In the year 1921, the Chuvash National Museum in Cheboksary founded the Society for the Study of Local Region, a scholarly organization dedicated to the exploration of the local area, dissemination of scientific knowledge about it, and promotion of cultural awareness among the Chuvash people about the life and traditions of various ethnic groups in the region. The members of this society engaged in meticulous record-keeping and documentation of archaeological sites. They actively participated in archaeological excavations, meticulously cataloging artifacts for future museum collections. On occasion, they conducted exploratory digs, meticulously examining tombstones inscribed with Arabic script. They delved into the analysis of ancient objects, including the excavation of the Tikhomirovsky Hoard, a cache of Jochid coins, in the year 1928.\n\nThe society has been divided into various sections, including natural history, historical and archaeological, ethnographic, socio-political, artistic and literary, scientific and educational, organisational and instructional, informational and since 1925, constitutional. This is where the real fun begins.\n\nAlthough the Chuvash nation gained separate autonomy within Russia, their powers were far from ideal for the Chuvash national leaders. The leaders of the society, particularly Metri Yuman, adopted the Bulgarist theory of the origins of the Chuvash as their main doctrine. In a series of works published in the 1920s, they advocated the claim that the Chuvash were the sole direct and pure descendants of the Volga-Kama Bulgarians and idealised the era of Volga Bulgaria's statehood. Members of the Society even discussed the idea of renaming the Chuvash Autonomous Region to the Bulgarian Autonomous Region and changing the name of the people from Chuvash to Bulgars. As a result, a strong movement among the Chuvash for Bulgarian identity emerged.\n\nIn the wake of the outbreak of civil war in Russia, the Society have fled from revolutionary Cheboksary to seek refuge in Kazan, where they now seek support from our administration. We are willing to assist them, yet this runs counter to our vision of establishing a Turko-Tatar nation, in which there is no room for the chauvinistic aspirations of the Bulgarist nationalists."

### Events for Kazan Khan ###
kazan.10.t: "Shafi Seizes the Kazan Kremlin"
kazan.10.d: "The Kazan Kremlin is an ancient fortress, the main citadel of Kazan and a symbol of the Tatar state. If Shafi Almas takes over the Kremlin, he will gain power and recognition. It is likely that we should consider his actions as an attempt at a military coup.\n\nBy the arrival of the joint troops of the Tatar legionnaires of Timer and the Bashkir troops of Tagan, the guards guarding the Kremlin were already wounded or killed, and the entrance to the Kremlin was barricaded. Almas ' legionnaires had taken over the building and were now defending its walls. Before the eyes of the Tatar and Bashkir leader, a yellow flag with the image of Zilant, the legendary Tatar dragon, the symbol of the Kazan Khanate, slowly rose above the Kremlin.\n\nImmediately starting the siege of the medieval fortress, the combined Tatar-Bashkir army faced a fierce defense of the Almas legionnaires. A couple dozen were killed, and dozens more were injured. However, the outcome of the battle was not yet decided..."
kazan.10.a: "The I-UMB Forces Were Destroyed"
kazan.10.b: "The Almas Legionnaires Give Up the Kremlin"

kazan.11.t: "In the Halls of Kremlin"
kazan.11.d: "Tagan and Timer were soon surrounded in a retaliatory strike and arrested. They were taken to the Kremlin, where they met Almas, dressed in the costume of the Kazan Khan. On his head was a replica of the cap of the Kazan khan. Timer and Tagan couldn't utter a single word, stunned by the sight.\n\nFinally, Almas spoke: 'I, being proclaimed by the Tatar people and called to rule, am the new Khan of Kazan, Shafi. And in accordance with the emergency decrees, I will defend my country and homeland from all those who attempt to destroy it. On behalf of the Tatar people, I sentence you to death by quartering.'\n\nHaving said this, Almas retired in his robes, asking the advisers of the "new khan" to send out to all the newspapers of the world that Khan Shafi of the Almas family had taken the Kazan Kremlin and announced the restoration of the Kazan Khanate, which had perished in time and centuries.'"
kazan.11.a: "The Khanate Returns!"

kazan.12.t: "In the Halls of Kremlin"
kazan.12.d: "Breaking into the fortress, and destroying the last defense of Almas, Timer and Tagan entered the chambers. In the middle of the hall stood Shafi Almas in the costume of the Kazan khan and with a replica of the Khan's hat on his head. He looked stupid and confused. Immediately, he was arrested and taken to the nearest police station, where he would be expected first to spend a night with drunks, and then to be tried for a failed military coup attempt and treason.\n\nHaving extinguished the last hotbeds of the Almas uprising, Timer and Tagan returned to the congress to complete it and make an important decision for the state. Timer was elected the new president of the Idel-Ural State by a majority vote of the delegates."
kazan.12.a: "Poor Shafi Almas, maybe he needs treatment..."

kazan.13.t: "Empowering Tatar Nobility"
kazan.13.d: "In Kazan society, the most privileged classes were the nobility and the clergy. The title of Karachi belonged to the heads of the four most noble Tatar families — Shirin, Bargin, Argyn and Kipchak, and was inherited. Karachi by their position were the closest advisers and de facto co-rulers of the Kazan Khan. Since then, many years have passed and there are no descendants of these noble families. And so the power will pass to those whom we ourselves recognize as the new Kazan nobility. And either they will bend the knee, or they will perish.\n\nAccording to the decree of the Khan of Kazan Shafi, of the Almas family, called the First, representatives of the upper classes of the Tatar nobility must appear at the Khan's palace in the Kazan Kremlin, kneel and swear eternal loyalty to the Khan. If they refuse, they will be executed. If they agree, they will receive lands and a legal title, their children will have the right to inherit their lands and titles, they will be forever loyal to the Khan and serve for the benefit of the Tatar State."
kazan.13.a: "And they all agreed..."

kazan.14.t: "All-Tatar Kurultai"
kazan.14.d: "Immediately summon the Whole Land of Kazan!\n\nAll the nobles, all the Karachis, Emirs and Tarkhans are called to the All-Tatar Kurultai, because we must recognize the legal authority of the Khan, choose the Seyid of Kazan and declare our sovereignty.\n\nA number of important documents will be adopted at the Kurutlai: the Khan's Charter - a set of laws and rules of conduct in the Kazan Khanate. From now on and forever, until the blood of the last Khan of Kazan is shed, which we will never allow, we will recognize him as our sovereign on behalf of all the subjects of Great Tartary. We recognize his authority as sacred and given by Allah for the sake of preserving the Tatar nation and sovereignty, for the sake of the prosperity of the Tatar society, the development of science, folk crafts and culture. From now on and forever, the power of the Khan is irrefutable and is recognized by all members of society as inalienable, irreversible and inescapable. Khan Shafi, of the House of Almas, called the First, is our Khan, our Leader, and our Salvation."
kazan.14.a: "We are the new Zemsky Sobor!"

kazan.15.t: "Feudalization of Tataria"
kazan.15.d: "Now that we have the honorable nobility, we will divide the lands of the Kazan Khanate and give them to the new four most noble families of Kazan - the eternal vassals of the Khan.\n\nBegelma-daruga, Chistai-daruga, Bolgar-daruga and Qazan-daruga will be given to them with the right of use and possession, all the inhabitants of these lands will have to swear allegiance to their suzerains, as they swore allegiance to the Khan. All dissenters will be enslaved or executed-at the discretion of their master, because now they are simply nothing but subjects of the Khan.\n\nTheir duties will include collecting tribute and paying tribute to the Khan, but in exchange they will be able to cultivate these lands, build factories and factories, anything to develop the great Khanate."
kazan.15.a: "They shall all obey."

kazan.16.t: "Ethnic Cleanses"
kazan.16.d: "Only one religion unites the Tatars and only it has the right to exist within the borders of the Khanate. And this is the religion - Islam. Every educated Tatar who is not enslaved is obliged to practice this religion, observe its rules and laws, and anyone who slanders the Prophet or the Khan does not observe our customs and traditions - he simply shits in our country.\n\nFrom now on, by the decree of the Great Khan, all the subjects of the Khanate are obliged to accept Islam and obey its vows. In case of refusal, as always, they will be quartered and destroyed, their ashes will be thrown into the Volga or Kama and carried away by its waves from the lands of the Khanate, because there is no place for the scum of society"
kazan.16.a: "One Religion. One Khan."

kazan.17.t: "The Zilant Awakens!"
kazan.17.d: "A Zilant is a legendary creature with the head of a dragon, the body of a bird, the legs of a chicken, the tail of a snake, the ears of a canine, red wings, sharp teeth, dark-gray feathers and scaly dark-gray skin.\n\nAccording to one story, a beautiful damsel married a resident of Old Kazan. She had to get water from the Qazansu River and complained to the local khan his capital was poorly situated. She advised him to move the city to Zilantaw Hill, and the khan agreed. However, the hill was infested with numerous snakes which were "stout as a log". Their leader was a giant two-headed snake, the Zilant. One head ate only grass, while the other swallowed virgins. A wizard advised the Khan to build a straw and wood near the hill. In spring, the snakes came out from their winter burrows and crept into the pile of straw. A knight errant was sent out to set the pile of straw on fire, burning out the snakes. They were deadly even in death, killing people and horses with their stink. However, the gigantic two-headed snake-dragon escaped to the Qaban lakes. According to the story he still lives in the waters of the lake and, from time to time, takes vengeance on the citizens.\n\nThe Zilant has for long been the symbol of Tataria, symbol of Khan and there's no doubt that it exists... the Khan believes in it anyway, and believes that his strength and power is dependent on Zilant. And now the Zilant has Awakened. By the fire and force of the Zilant, the Kazan Khanate will rebuilt itself and destroy traitorous Russians that still claim that this is their land. It is no more and they shall be taught a lesson."
kazan.17.a: "The Zilant Shall Destroy the Muscovy!"

kazan.18.t: "The Kazan Khan Captures Moscow"
kazan.18.d: "The troops of the great Khan finally laid siege to Moscow and stormed the ancient fortress - a symbol of Russian statehood. Soon, Khan Shafi himself arrived in the capital, who solemnly raised a yellow flag with a zilant over the Kremlin. On the same day, a messenger was immediately dispatched with a telegram to the leader of Muscovy - demanding that he kneel before Khan Shafi of the house of Almas, called the First."

Besides, there will be no more Russia.
