ECU_laicity: "Uphold Secularity"
ECU_laicity_desc: "The PLRE historically opposed the domination of the church in [ROOT.GetName] by promoting secularity to a national level.

# Democracy #
ECU_balance_powers: "Balance of Powers"
ECU_balance_powers_desc: "With the surprise victory of the Conservatives in the last elections a sort of balance of powers between the two main parties was put into place during the confusion.

ECU_democracy_restored: "Democracy Re-established"

All together the form the technocratic elite of the Republic."
ECU_cities_cooperation: "Interurban Cooperation"

ECU_tothelastman: "Quito Perimeter"
ECU_tothelastman_desc: "Our beautiful capital city is in a very defensible location, up in the Andes. However, that doesn't mean that it is invulnerable. We need to further fortify Quito and have it serve as a stronghold in case of a successful foreign invasion."

ECU_control_our_seas: "Control Our Seas"
ECU_control_our_seas_desc: "The sea around [ROOT.GetName] and all the way to the Galapagos shall forever be controlled by [ROOT.GetName]: it is in our vital interest... as long as no larger navy actually tries to contest it."

ECU_local_consumption: "Promote Local Consumption"
ECU_local_consumption_desc: "Transportation and importation cost a good amount of money, instead we should promote local consumption. Instead of importing food from Argentina, why not eat [ROOT.GetAdjective] food? Furthermore this national market can help us sell our stocks in times of crisis when exports fall, better sell a product at a low price than not sell it at all."

ECU_neweconomicplan: "State Plans"
ECU_neweconomicplan_desc: "Our latest economic policies have helped the economy to come back on its feet, and now it can finally support larger civilian investments. The growth rate is high and stable, so why not make it even higher?"

### Events ###
ecu.0.t: "Shadow of Its Former Self"
ecu.0.d: "The state once known as [ROOT.GetName] suffered some bumpy early years shortly after its independence in 1809. Border uncertainties led to conflicts with Peru and Colombia while rival oligarchies between large landowning conservatives in the highlands and the liberal populace on the coast fought each other bitterly.\n\nIn the midst of all this a disaster struck: [ROOT.GetName]'s neighbors, Colombia and Peru, began fighting a border war over the control of the Amazonian city of Leticia and it's immediate surroundings. The small conflict quickly became full-scale war, but the aggressor, Peru, wasn't able to make any gains and quickly turned its attention toward Ecuador.\nPlanning to march into Colombia via Quito, they sent an unexpected ultimatum to then president Alberto Guerrero Martinez, who quickly asked for international support to defend his country. However the rest of the world turned a blind eye to the matter and without any other option he pledged his allegiance to Colombia.\nWhat followed was a complete embarrassment for the [ROOT.GetAdjective] people as the unprepared army struggled and soon failed to stop the invading Peruvian army.\n\nOnce the conflict ended, Ecuador lost its independence and was reduced to a puppet government by their former rival, losing all of its eastern territories and getting it's name changed to Quitaquil, while Colombia lost much of its southern land and fell into chaos. After a one year period of occupation, with things returning to apparent normality, Peru decided to allow an allied civil government to rule within the limit of regular administration. Thus ex-president Isidro Ayora Cuerva, who had once been the charismatic leader of the classical liberal wing of PLRE, was brought back to lead the country once again.\nDespite what the Peruvians think, the situation in Quitaquil is all but calm. No matter the decision by its overlord to make fringe groups such as socialists and national populists illegal, these extremists are incessantly working in the underground and attracting the public with their rebirth narrative.\nNonetheless, no one really knows what's in Quitaquil's future, neither Peru nor Quitaquil itself."
ecu.0.a: "Let's find that out!"

ecu.1.t: "The Annual Review Boosts Our Confidence"
ecu.1.d: "As it's the norm, Peru has prepared it's annual review to assess the situation inside our nation and our relationship with them. What came out paints a somewhat positive picture for our future togheter.\n\nEconomic and stability goals have been and the trust in our overlord from our citizens is slowly growing, as more and more people are feeling more secure with them that what they have ever felt otherwise.\n\nAs such Peru asks us, in the last paragraph of the document, to keep the people happy and the economy strong and free as we are currently doing and assure their effort lesser and lesser deployment of troops in our country.\nMany analysts suggests that by the end of the year or the start of the next Peru could concede us a greater deal of independence."
ecu.0.a: "That's some great news!"

ecu.16.t: "Bad News from the Annual Review"
ecu.16.d: "As it's the norm, Peru has prepared it's annual review to assess the situation inside our nation and our relationship with them. What came out paints a bad picture for our future togheter.\n\nPeru expresses significant dissatisfaction with our economic and stability developments. Additionally, our brothers in Lima are highly concerned about our handling of reactionary elements attempting to destabilize the government, as highlighted in the report.\n\nAs soon as the report came into our office a sentiment of dread spread around. The more pessimistic among us interpret this as an implicit warning of potential challenges ahead, including the possibility of a full-scale military occupation by Peru since this is the second year in a row that the review turns out negative. We should not underestimate the fact that these documents clearly indicate deep dissatisfaction from our counterparts in Lima, and we must consider the implications of their discontent."
ecu.16.a: "Come on! It can't be so bad..."

ecu.2.t: "The March Crisis"
ecu.2.d: "The economists have been doing quite the effort to pretend otherwise, but Black Monday has ruined [ROOT.GetName] in a very thorough manner. Indeed, exports of cocoa from [ROOT.GetName] dropped dramatically following the crash, our biggest heavy industries almost stopped to and halt and unlike during the previous crash in 1925 when the conservatives held up on power, the political pressure has mounted, and riots broke out in Quito, Guayaquil and in many other cities, inspired by populist movements."
ecu.2.a: "Dios Mios!"

ecu.3.t: "Peru gets ready to occupy us"
ecu.3.d: "Diplomats from our overlord are notifying us of Peru's preparations for a potential military occupation of our nation, with the intention of establishing a temporary junta aligned with their national interests. They emphasize Peru's profound dissatisfaction with our achievements from the past year and our overall governance.\nDue to these concerns, among others, they urge us to peacefully step down and facilitate a smooth transition, stressing the preservation of our existing borders. They reassure us that this is a temporary measure and promise a return of power once stability is restored.\n\nWhile many have lost hope, a small fraction of our cabinet remains steadfast in their belief that we can rectify the situation. Since receiving the annual review, they have diligently drafted a plan for changes that Lima may find favorable and meaningful. These changes aim to demonstrate our commitment and determination to lead Quitaquil towards the path of greatness, alongside our friend and master Peru.\nWhat shall we do?"
ecu.3.a: "We must do what's best for Quitaquil, step down."
ecu.3.b: "José, send them those documents, ahora mismo!"

ecu.30.t: "The Compactación Obrera Nacional"
ecu.30.d: "With the crisis making the country plunge into misery and political strife, more voice was given to small and new political movements. One of them is the Compactación Obrera Nacional, a reactionary and populist movement that plays on opposing itself to the mainstream conservative and radical liberal parties. The party's mission is supposedly centered on enhancing the quality of life for the people and restoring their central role in the political landscape.\nTheir stance toward our overlord Peru remains ambiguous, however, seemingly shifting based on the context. When addressing a nationalist audience, they speak with fiery condemnation of our brethren in Lima. However, in the presence of moderates or pacifists, they evoke the memories of older times and the amicable relations between our nations.\nWhen directly questioned about this inconsistency, their leader, Neptalí Bonifaz Ascázubi, cryptically responded, 'When time comes, you'll see!'\n\nDrawing its membership primarily from the urban working classes, the movement employed unconventional tactics for [ROOT.GetAdjective] politics, including street parades and open public celebrations. These initiatives proved successful, as the Neptalí garnered a substantial following.\nNow the problem for them is to know if they will be able to continue being influential even after the worse of the crisis has passed."
ecu.30.a: "Time will tell."

ecu.9.t: "Gallo steps down?"
ecu.9.d: "After a few years of harsh rule by Gallo and his military clique, it is finally time to put the new constitution written by the clique into place to restore democracy in [ROOT.GetName] at last. The new constitution has widespread approval throughout the country and the army but it might be possible that, with a last chance move, the army decides to further suspend the institution of the constitution. Should the Republic be restored and new elections be called?"
ecu.9.a: "It's finally time to organise free elections."
ecu.9.b: "Never! The military shall protect the constitution forever!"

ecu.10.t: "First Free [ROOT.GetAdjective] Elections, 1941"
ecu.10.d: "Today is election day for the first time in [ROOT.GetName] since the end of the Gallo dictatorship! The renewed democratic process again brought forward the two dominating parties of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] 20th century: the Radical Liberals and the Conservatives. While their biggest leaders like Isidro Ayora and former president José María Velasco Ibarra have been distanced from any power, the parties still have many capable politicians and keep close ties to the rest of the elites in the country. However the dictatorship seems to have restarted the counters and no candidate looks particularly more advantaged than the other in the elections. It will be a closely fought fight between the liberal Carlos Arroyo del Río and the conservative Antonio Pons Campuzano."
ecu.10.a: "The Radical Liberals win!"
ecu.10.b: "The Conservative Party wins!"

ecu.11.t: "[ROOT.GetAdjective] Elections, 1941"
ecu.11.d: "Today is election day again in [ROOT.GetName]! After the surprise conservative win in the 1936 elections the political forces have more or less balanced in the country and no party seems to be able to get a hold on the other. These elections will thus be closely fought between the radical liberal Carlos Arroyo del Río and the conservative Antonio Pons Campuzano."
ecu.11.a: "The Radical Liberals win!"
ecu.11.b: "The Conservative Party wins!"

ecu.12.t: "[ROOT.GetAdjective] Elections, 1946"
ecu.12.d: "Today is election day again in [ROOT.GetName]! Democracy has been working out somewhat correctly in [ROOT.GetName] despite the still vast corruption and clientelism but the good side is that there is now a real competition between the Conservative party of Neptalí Bonifaz Ascaszubi and the Radical Liberal party of Alfredo Baquerizo Moreno. We wonder what will be the result of this voting day."
ecu.12.a: "The Radical Liberals win!"
ecu.12.b: "The Conservative Party wins!"

ecu.13.t: "[ROOT.GetAdjective] Elections, 1951"
ecu.13.d: "Election day for [ROOT.GetName] today! The two dominating parties in the politics of the country, the Radical Liberals and the Conservatives are opposing candidates for another mandate of 5 years. This could sound like business as usual but this election has a special feeling to it: Indeed while the Radical Liberals chose the famous liberal leader of the March Crisis Idiro Ayora as their candidate, the conservatives chose former president José María Velasco Ibarra who was deposed during this same March crisis. Whoever wins from what looks like a reenactment of 1936 will probably make some chuckle but in the end one of them will be president. But who?"
ecu.13.a: "The Radical Liberals win!"
ecu.13.b: "The Conservative Party wins!"

ecu.14.t: "[ROOT.GetAdjective] Elections, 1956"
ecu.14.d: "Today is election day again in [ROOT.GetName]! The usual two parties are competing again and brought forward their candidates: Andrés Fernández de Córdova Nieto for the radical liberals and Mariano Suárez Veintimilla for the Conservatives. Both relatively new, some think they will bring fresh blood to Ecuatorian politics."
ecu.14.a: "The Radical Liberals win!"
ecu.14.b: "The Conservative Party wins!"

ecu.17.t: "New Laws for a Fairer [ROOT.GetName]"
ecu.17.d: "The liberal majority in the assembly and the president have been at work to reform the country and break the influence of the former pre-war conservative elite. Part of that process is a classic move of centralisation of power around the president and growing authoritarianism in the [ROOT.GetAdjective] republic, however all of that is made very legally.\nIndeed, the parliament has been hard at work these last days voting laws reducing its own power and comforting the liberal supremacy despite criticisms from the opposition. This work will continue but the liberal group is divided about the response that should be given to the opposition forces. Should we try to work with them to ease the tensions and make the liberal rule more comfortable or should we refuse any compromise and implement all of what we want alone?"
ecu.17.a: "Compromise with the opposition."
ecu.17.b: "We were elected, we do what we want."

ecu.18.t: "The Coastal Elite"
ecu.18.d: "It's 5PM in Quito in this late saturday afternoon, in a well-known bar named 'El Zorro' close to the presidential palace meets the top of the crop of [ROOT.GetAdjective] society. There liberal politicians meet with wealthy cacao farmers of the coast and the most trendy bankers of Guayaquil. All of this elite, that met for the first time under Eloy Alfaro's regime at the turn of the century reunited for power under our legitimate president and it is now with them that [ROOT.GetName] is managed. And it's in this bar that the most important decisions of the country are actually negotiated or even decided. After all the interest of the bankers is to have clients and the interest of the farmers is to have money for their enterprise, in a country where export cultures make up most of the wealth, it is only natural for this duo to be in power..."
ecu.18.a: "The liberal world is back on track."

ecu.19.t: "The Rebirth of Guayaquil"
ecu.19.d: "Guayaquil, with its port and its banks, was the capital of the liberal world at the start of the 20th century. Even after that period, it stayed a close competer of the supremacy of Quito. The institution of the new elite gave wings to the city that is now booming with life again, while the important banks were broken up and controlled by the conservatives they are now regrouping to be as strong as ever and dominate the life in Guayaquil. At the port, exports were severely hit by the impact of Black Monday but cacao and bananas are now flowing again. The city became the point of attention of the whole country and many are the destitute farmers fleeing their land to find a job in the dream of the agitated nights of Guayaquil."
ecu.19.a: "Guayaquil, you are a lady!"

ecu.20.t: "The Banks' Actions Endanger Farmers"
ecu.20.d: "We should have known empowering bankers doesn't only come with advantages, and past examples in history have proven its danger. But nevertheless we didn't listen and gave too much leeway to the bankers in Guayaquil. With their newfound power they began funding and speculating on agriculture like never before, sadly not always to the advantage of the farmers. After a complex financial manipulation involving several relationships between farmers and loaners, a sudden destabilisation of the cultures in a region west of Guayaquil led to the bankruptcy of several cacao farmers, and much profit for the bankers. This unfortunate event turned into a national scandal when these influential farmers started agitating their colleagues against the government's favor toward the moneymen. Now, spread by newspapers and talked about on the street, we can't ignore this issue anymore and have to bring an answer to it. What will it be?"
ecu.20.a: "Punish the banks and relieve the farmers."
ecu.20.b: "Do nothing; after all this is the free market."

ecu.21.t: "Forming a Government"
ecu.21.d: "Gallo and his military clique just took over all the political powers in [ROOT.GetName] and suspended the course of the usual constitution for the time being. As such, the government was dissolved and Gallo replaced it with an unofficial council of advisers largely taking from his friends in the military. However this situation can't last forever and if we want to bring stability to [ROOT.GetName] we first have to provide it a stable government. Now the question is who to bring in it? Considering the discredit of the Conservative and Liberal parties, even if they are still the most powerful, allying with them would be risky and allying with the gruesome syndicalists of the PSIE is out of question. We can also look to the way of the recently-founded Compactación Obrera Nacional, a populist party basing itself on the masses and its hate for syndicalism and created in response to the disaster of the economic crises, it's not the most popular amongst the [ROOT.GetAdjective] elites but it's the closest party to our ideology. Though whatever we choose, a good chunk of the important positions will still be filled by military men to secure the survival of the regime. What shall we do?"
ecu.21.a: "Use some elements from the Compactación."
ecu.21.b: "Take from all sides of the political spectrum to rally the people."
ecu.21.c: "Only the army knows best!"

ecu.22.t: "A Syndicalist Spy!"
ecu.22.d: "Our secret services surprised in the streets of Quito a man with a quite strange behaviour. He was walking, looking uncomfortable, constantly watching around him and some people say they saw a syndicalist emblem on part of his clothes. That's this last clue that convinced our secret services to investigate him more thoroughly. According to their reports they then discovered he wasn't a simple [ROOT.GetAdjective] citizen but a syndicalist spy working with the PSIE and the French Commune to prepare a future revolution! This unacceptable threat was quickly removed with the sudden arrest of the spy in the middle of a meeting with corrupt politicians in a gloomy bar in Quito. With the spy now in jail and the country enraged at him, we must now decide his fate, should we leave him to a popular trial in the streets or should we prepare a grand and official trial to make an example of him?"
ecu.22.a: "Leave him to a popular 'trial'!"
ecu.22.b: "Make an official example of him to show those syndies!"

ecu.23.t: "The Grandiose Trial of the Spy"
ecu.23.d: "The syndicalist entered the great court of Quito at 8 in the morning, for the start of the trial, accompanied by the attorney chosen by the interior ministry. Facing him was the judge and most importantly, the prosecutor. In the room, hundreds of people pressed themselves to see the fate of the spy while his several crimes our secret services discovered were listed. After that, a brief time was left for his defence before the speech of the prosecutor and the quick decision of the judge: the spy is the culprit and will be executed by decapitation as soon as possible for the good of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] State. This exemplar protest will be an example for the future of our struggle against dissidents and syndicalists."
ecu.23.a: "And the head falls."

ecu.24.t: "Purifying the Press"
ecu.24.d: "As part of the process of strengthening the rule of the military in the country, one target will have to be the multiple newspapers [ROOT.GetName] has. Coming from different sides of the political spectrum and influenced by big parties, the information and analysis conveyed in them don't always appeal to Gallo and might endanger the stability of the new state. As such a reorganisation of the press to bring it more in line with patriotic ideals will be started and we will make sure no one will spread dangerous reports in authorized newspapers anymore."
ecu.24.a: "Only the real patriots will stay."

ecu.25.t: "Dissent Amongst the Officers"
ecu.25.d: "As no revolts happened consequentially to the Gallo coup, it might be believed that all of the army got behind the new government but that would be a foolish assumption. Indeed, separate from Gallo's clique and more authoritarian leaning generals, there is an important fraction of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] military that follows progressive ideals and grows more and more opposed to the dictatorship of General Gallo. These officers and soldiers claim the army is here not to opress but to defend the people against enemies on the outside and the inside and that protecting democracy is also a part of that mission. This fraction is quickly becoming dangerous for the stability of the government that could be teared apart easily by intense infighting. To prevent this break up, the solution would be to make this fraction totally disappear in one way or another. A quick elimination will solve the problem immediately but will shock not only the people but also more military men and it might be wise to make this elimination more progressive. What will we do?"
ecu.25.a: "Purge the disloyals right now!"
ecu.25.b: "We will take more gradual steps..."

ecu.26.t: "Rallying the Army"
ecu.26.d: "The army has been a backbone of the construction and stabilisation of [ROOT.GetAdjective] democracy and as such also holds important leverage over its survival or not. To protect democracy, the army must be completely integrated into it and given positions of prestige amongst the [ROOT.GetAdjective] elites. At the same time, we'll teach the youth to love its army and will promote the military with programs throughout the whole nation. The army must become the most loyal defender of democracy if we want it to last."
ecu.26.a: "The army is the protector of democracy."

ecu.38.t: "The Misadventure of an Explorer"
ecu.38.d: "An unfortunate story reached the presidential palace today, it seems an American explorer who got a permit to explore and cast a movie about volcanoes in the [ROOT.GetAdjective] Andes suffered from a painful death. Accompanied by a local guide, the explorer was climbing up one of the most impressive volcanoes in the region when he decided to take better shots of the lava by filming it directly. Despite the warnings of the guide, the explorer proceeded to lean on the side of the volcano, further and further, until he fell heads down in the pit while his guide watched in horror. The [ROOT.GetAdjective] government announced the news to the American ambassador and expressed its deepest condolences for this accident."
ecu.38.a: "This yank is on fire..."

ecu.44.t: "A New Flag Proposal" #regular version
ecu.44.d: "The introduction of a new constitution has not only brought celebration and increased stability across the country but has also provided our Alfarist Government with a means to establish its legitimacy. This design features our nation's founding figure Eloy Alfaro alongside Field Marshal Gallo, proudly holding the constitution for the world to see.\n\nInterestingly, an art critic from the capital had the chance to view this proposed flag when the minister extended an invitation. The critic's response was rather blunt: 'Total rubbish. Most probably the worst thing I have ever seen put on paper, ever.'\n\nDespite a few critics, the prevailing sentiment appears to favor a change. Should we proceed with this redesign?"
ecu.44.a: "Ecuador will kneel in front of my picture, proceed."
ecu.44.b: "I think the current one is good enough."

ecu.45.t: "A New Flag Proposal" #meme version
ecu.45.d: "The introduction of a new constitution has not only brought celebration and increased stability across the country but has also provided our Alfarist Government with a means to establish its legitimacy. This design features our nation's founding figure Eloy Alfaro alongside popular singer Kanye Oeste, proudly holding the constitution for the world to see.\n\nInterestingly, an art critic from the capital had the chance to view this proposed flag when the minister extended an invitation. The critic's response was rather inspiring: 'Brilliant. Most probably the best thing I have ever seen put on paper, ever.'\n\nShould we proceed with this redesign?"
ecu.45.a: "Ecuador will kneel in front of Oeste's picture, proceed."
ecu.45.b: "I think the current one is good enough."


##Generals and Admirals##

ECU_Enriquez_Gallo_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 24, 1894, in Latacunga, Cotopaxi province, Ecuador\n§YMilitary Career:§W Enriquez first saw himself in the military in 1900, when he met Eloy Alfaro after a battle against President Lizardo García's forces. Gallo's encounter with Alfaro instilled a selfless patriotism in him, leading him to volunteer in 1910 to fight against Perú. He was accepted as a drummer in the Pichicha battalion and reached the rank of Corporal before the war ended. He finally decided to abandon his studies in 1911, where he joined the Montero Revolutionary army. His first combat experience was holding a bridge against Flavio Alfaro's forces with tree soldiers, where they managed to hold out for a whole day successfully despite heavy fighting. In 1912 he was tasked by his CEO to apply for the 'Escuela de Aplicación para Militares Inferiores', graduating as a second lieutenant. From there he kept climbing through the ranks until becoming Captain in 1918. In 1922, he was sent to Guayaquil, where he ordered a bayonet charge against a group of strikers that were disturbing the peace in the city. Gallo saw them as a threat to Ecuador, ordering the execution of many strikers, who where then thrown in the Guayas River to dispose of the evidence. During the years of the liberal elite clique, despite his ideological differences with the government, Gallo has followed orders and has strived to keep stability in Ecuador, allowing him to gain the rank of Field Marshall.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Despite having liberal views, Gallo worries more about Ecuador as a whole than about the Liberal/Conservative divide, and will do his duty no matter who's in charge."
