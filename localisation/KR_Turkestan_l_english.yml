turkestan_railway_crisis.1.t: "Main Railroad Worshops Hit By Strikes"
turkestan_railway_crisis.1.d: "In the wake of economic turmoil and political unrest throughout Russia, the Central Asian Railway has been thrown into disarray. The Main Railroad Workshops in Tashkent, a crucial hub for the railway, is now paralyzed due to worker strikes. These strikes were incited by various groups, including the ERK party and russophone socialist organizations. The situation has become critical, as the Russian Garrison stationed in New Tashkent finds itself isolated from Petrograd due to the disruption of communication lines. The Garrison has urgently requested our assistance in quelling the strikes to restore order and ensure the railway's functionality.\n\nHowever, within our government, there are differing opinions on how to approach this crisis. Our Ittifoqi Muslimin coalition allies, as well as oppositional ERK party members are calling for a bold move to disarm the Russian Garrison and regain control of New Tashkent, asserting our independence and authority. Such a move could have significant consequences for our relations with the Russian government. On the other hand, Madamin-Bek has proposed a cooperative effort to disarm the Garrison, which he believes could help strengthen our sovereignity. But this proposition is seen by Shokai as too radical, potentially bolstering Madamin-Bek's rival government even further."
turkestan_railway_crisis.1.a: "Assist the Russian Garrison."
turkestan_railway_crisis.1.b: "The Russians are no longer to command."
turkestan_railway_crisis_1_a_tt: "§lWe must prioritize maintaining a stable relationship with the Russian government. We must assist the Russian Garrison in suppressing the strikes, ensuring that Petrograd remains satisfied with our cooperation.§!"
turkestan_railway_crisis_1_b_tt: "§gWe will give green light to Madamin-Bek's intentions for a disarmament of the Russian Garrison.§!"

turkestan_railway_crisis.2.t: "Suppression of Strikes"
turkestan_railway_crisis.2.d: "Turkestan had long been a land of diverse cultures and voices, but in the midst of a severe crisis, those differences had taken on a more ominous tone. The worker strikes in Tashkent had ground the city's industrial heart to a halt, and their demands reverberated through the streets, echoing a call for greater autonomy and power. With the Russian Garrison in New Tashkent cut off from their Petrograd overlords, the situation became dire. The Russian Garrison turned to us, seeking assistance to suppress the strikes and regain control of the city. It was a fateful moment for our government led by Mustafa Shokai, as we had to decide where our loyalty truly lay. The orders were given, and the Turkestan National Guard, known for its loyalty to the government, was dispatched to Tashkent. Clad in their distinctive uniforms and bearing the emblem of Turkestan's flag, they entered the city with stern determination. As they arrived at the Main Railroad Workshop, the heart of the strike, they found a sea of workers, faces hardened by the trials of life, standing united. The atmosphere was tense, the air thick with anticipation. Mustafa Shokai's government had chosen to prioritize its relationship with Russia, and the consequences of this decision were about to play out. The Turkestan National Guard, armed and ready, moved in to disperse the crowds. It was a scene of turmoil, as shouts and cries filled the air. The workers resisted, chanting slogans of Turkestan's independence and socialist revolution. But the Guard's orders were clear, and they used force to suppress the strikes. In the end, the strikes were forcibly quelled. The Main Railroad Workshop, once a symbol of workers' power, fell back into the hands of the authorities. The Russian Garrison, accompanied by our forces, resumed control of New Tashkent.\n\nThe immediate outcome was the restoration of order, a sigh of relief from those who had longed for stability. Russia commended our cooperation, and the Russian Garrison's influence grew stronger in Turkestan. But within our nation, a growing sense of resentment began to take root. Nationalists and the ERK party saw us as compromising our autonomy for the sake of foreign interests. As the dust settled and the workers' voices faded, Turkestan found itself at a crossroads - with the potential consequences leading to our failure, or rise."
turkestan_railway_crisis.2.a: "At least, we have stabilized the situation."

turkestan_railway_crisis.3.t: "Coalition Shattered"
turkestan_railway_crisis.3.d: "The fragile coalition that held Turkestan together, forged in the fires of necessity, was now unraveling at its seams. The decision made by Mustafa Shokai's government had struck at the very core of the partnership. As the Turkestan National Guard suppressed the worker strikes in Tashkent, the cracks that had long existed between the Jadidists and the Qadhimists, representing the Turkiston Milliy Ittihod (Turkestan National Union) and Ittifoqi Muslimin (Union of Muslims) respectively, grew into unbridgeable chasms. The announcement came like a thunderclap in the political landscape of Turkestan. The Qadhimists, the more traditional and fundamentalist faction of the coalition, had decided to break away. They declared their support for Madamin-Bek's rival government, seeing in him a leader who could better represent their vision for Turkestan. The halls of power in Turkestan were filled with the clamor of discontented voices. Qadhimist leaders, once part of the coalition, now distanced themselves from the very government they had helped form. The divisions ran deep, and Turkestan's political stability was hanging by a thread.\n\nFor Mustafa Shokai, the decision had been a calculated gamble to maintain the balance between Russian interests and internal autonomy. However, the fallout was more significant than anyone could have predicted. With the Qadhimists now openly supporting the rival government, the Turkestan National Union was left weakened, its grip on power slipping. As the days unfolded, the government found itself facing a stark choice. As the situation slowly descends into chaos, there are voices that Shokai might abandon democratic institutions and dissolve the coalition altogether in the name of stability and control."
turkestan_railway_crisis.3.a: "The choice is yet to be made."

turkestan_railway_crisis.4.t: "ERK Calls for Turkestan-Wide Riots"
turkestan_railway_crisis.4.d: "The discontent in Turkestan had reached a boiling point. The ERK party, with its radical vision for a Turkestan united under socialist principles, had been agitating in the shadows for too long. Now, they saw an opportunity to seize the moment and launch a revolution that would reshape the region.\n\nFrom Tashkent to Kokand, from Samarkand to Pishpek, the call echoed through the cities and countryside. ERK had declared an all-Turkestan strike, urging workers of all backgrounds and ethnicities to unite against the perceived oppression of Mustafa Shokai's government. They promised equality, workers' rights, and an end to the perceived influence of Russian settlers.\n\nThe Dehkan peasants, long burdened by economic hardships and land inequality, answered this call with fervor. Riots erupted in towns and villages, as they demanded land reform and an end to their suffering. The Turkestan Republic was engulfed in a wave of protest and agitation.\n\nAs the news of the strikes and riots spread, Shokai's government found itself facing a grave challenge. ERK had managed to unite various factions under its banner, creating a broad-based coalition of discontent. The fragile stability that had been painstakingly built was now crumbling, and the fate of Turkestan hung in the balance."
turkestan_railway_crisis.4.a: "The ERK was always a threat to our rule."

turkestan_railway_crisis.5.t: "East Pamir Revolt"
turkestan_railway_crisis.5.d: "The rugged mountains of East Pamir have long been a bastion of Islamic faith, and it's in this remote and challenging terrain that a new and formidable challenge to Turkestan's stability has emerged. Kurshirmat, the charismatic leader of the East Pamir Mujahideen, has declared the establishment of a rival government.\n\nIn a fiery proclamation, Kurshirmat called for the creation of a pan-Islamist Turkestan, united under the banner of Sharia and Quran. He condemned what he saw as the weak and secular governance of Mustafa Shokai's administration and labeled it as an affront to true Islamic principles.\n\nThe Mujahideen had gained considerable support from local communities, and their declaration sent shockwaves throughout the region. They promised to restore the might of the Mujahideen, protect Islamic values, and free Turkestan from foreign influences. Their ranks swelled with passionate recruits, and they began to assert control over East Pamir.\n\nFor Mustafa Shokai's government, this posed a serious threat. Kurshirmat's movement was not only religious but also deeply nationalistic. It tapped into the shared identity of many Turkestanis, who yearned for independence and a return to their Islamic roots."
turkestan_railway_crisis.5.a: "Another hotbed of resistance!"

turkestan_railway_crisis.6.t: "Turkestan Descends into Civil War"
turkestan_railway_crisis.6.d: "Turkestan, once a land of relative stability, has now plunged into the abyss of civil strife. The fragile peace that held the region together has shattered, with multiple factions vying for control.\n\nIn the heart of Turkestan, the city of Tashkent has fallen into the hands of the ERK party. Their calls for revolution have been answered, and they now wield considerable influence in the capital. To the east, Madamin-Bek has made his move. His forces are converging on Kokand, determined to seize power and establish his vision of Turkestan's future. Kokand, once a bastion of resistance against him, is now the focal point of a bitter struggle. Meanwhile, in the city of Osh, Kurshirmat and his Mujahideen have taken control. With their pan-Islamist agenda, they are determined to establish a new order, governed by their interpretation of Sharia law. The loyalist forces, aligned with Mustafa Shokai's government, are fortifying their positions in Kokand. They believe it is there they must make their stand, for the future of Turkestan hangs in the balance."

turkestan_railway_crisis.7.t: "Russian Garrison Refused to Disarm!"
turkestan_railway_crisis.7.d: "Despite the calls of Madamin-Bek and his loyalists for a voluntary disarmament of the Russian Garrison, they refused to do so. The Madamin-Bek's forces have recently arrived in Tashkent, where the strikes paralyzed the life of city more and more and the tensions have drastically increased. As the Garrison's refusal was loudly heard across the region, the strikers call for decisive action against the Garrison and the Russians. With our government only tacitly watching the conflict, hopefully there won't be any serious clashes in the city borders."
turkestan_railway_crisis.7.a: "It seems that something bad is going to happen."

turkestan_railway_crisis.8.t: "Major Incident in Tashkent"
turkestan_railway_crisis.8.d: "Tensions in New Tashkent had reached a boiling point. The Russian Garrison, steadfast in their refusal to disarm, had become increasingly confrontational with our government. Meanwhile, the presence of Madamin-Bek's loyal troops, stationed nearby, cast an ominous shadow over the city.\n\nIt was a sweltering afternoon when the incident unfolded. A routine patrol by Russian soldiers, meant to showcase their strength and assert dominance, took an unexpected turn. As they passed through a crowded market square, a verbal altercation erupted between the Russian patrol and local vendors. Harsh words turned into shoving, and before long, fists were flying. The bustling marketplace transformed into a chaotic battleground. Nearby residents, many of them sympathizers of either Madamin-Bek's cause or the strikers, rushed to the scene to confront the Russian soldiers. The situation quickly escalated from brawls to armed clashes. Shots rang out, and chaos engulfed the streets of Tashkent. It was a fierce and bloody confrontation, with neither side willing to back down. The clashes lasted for hours, leaving casualties on both sides and sowing fear and panic among the civilian population. Madamin-Bek's loyal troops, who had been stationed just outside the city, received frantic reports of the violence erupting in Tashkent. Determined to protect their leader's interests, they swiftly moved in to quell the unrest. The arrival of reinforcements further intensified the fighting.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, the sounds of gunfire gradually faded, replaced by the wails of the wounded and the anguished cries of those who had lost loved ones. Tashkent had become a city scarred by violence and hatred, torn between loyalty to Russia and allegiance to Turkestan"
turkestan_railway_crisis.8.a: "Catastrophic!"

turkestan_railway_crisis.9.t: "Shokai's Dilemma"
turkestan_railway_crisis.9.d: "The violent clashes in Tashkent did not go unnoticed by the Russian government. Reports of the confrontation between the Russian Garrison and Madamin-Bek's loyal troops reached the highest echelons of power in Petrograd. The response from Russia was swift and unambiguous.\n\nRussian diplomats, acting on behalf of the Russian Government, delivered a stern message to Mustafa Shokai's administration. The message carried both condemnation and a clear threat. Russia, already grappling with internal turmoil, saw the incidents in Turkestan as a challenge to their authority in the region. They demanded immediate action to disarm Madamin-Bek's forces and restore order, warning that failure to comply would have dire consequences.\n\nIn response, Shokai's government found itself at a crossroads. On one hand, they could choose to pursue a diplomatic solution by cooperating with the Russian Garrison and taking measures to rein in Madamin-Bek's activities. This option might appease Russia and potentially mitigate further conflict. However, it could also be seen as compromising Turkestan's sovereignty and could lead to unrest among those who supported the cause of independence. On the other hand, Shokai's government could opt for a stance of neutrality, seeking to stay out of the conflict and leave Garrison's fate to Madamin-Bek's troops. Finally, this can be a perfect chance to independently crush Madamin-Bek's forces, supporting the Garrison - but using the chance to crush the Russian colonialists as well. The decision rested heavily on Shokai's shoulders, as he grappled with the complex web of alliances and rivalries that defined the political landscape of Turkestan. The future of the nation hung in the balance, and the consequences of this choice would shape the destiny of Turkestan for years to come."
turkestan_railway_crisis.9.d2: "The violent clashes in Tashkent went unnoticed by the Russian government. Reports of the confrontation between the Russian Garrison and Madamin-Bek's loyal troops reached the highest echelons of power in Petrograd. However, there was no response from Russia...\n\nLeaving the Garrison to its fate, the Russians are likely to lose all of their control over Turkestan now. On the other hand, Shokai's government could now opt for a stance of neutrality, seeking to stay out of the conflict and leave Garrison's fate to Madamin-Bek's troops.

turkestan_railway_crisis.10.t: "Tashkent Accords"
turkestan_railway_crisis.10.d: "In the wake of the Russian government's stern warnings and the escalating tensions within Turkestan, Mustafa Shokai faced an agonizing decision. Faced with the choice of either aligning with Russia or preserving Turkestan's independence, he ultimately opted for a diplomatic solution.\n\nShokai dispatched a team of envoys to negotiate with Russian representatives, proposing a fragile alliance that could serve the interests of both parties. His proposal outlined the following terms:\nTurkestan-Russian Accord: Shokai offered to form a Turkestan-Russian Accord, which would see both the Russian Garrison and Turkestan's National Guard coordinating their efforts to maintain peace and stability in the region. In the event of an open conflict involving other factions within Turkestan, the Russian government would pledge military support to Shokai's government.\nNeutrality in Disarmament: In exchange for Russian support, Shokai committed to remain neutral in the ongoing disarmament of the Russian Garrison in New Tashkent. He would not interfere with Madamin-Bek's efforts to disarm the Garrison and would allow the process to proceed unimpeded.\nMaintaining Autonomy: Shokai reaffirmed his commitment to maintaining Turkestan's allegiance within the Russian sphere of influence. While the alliance with Russia was a strategic move, he insisted that Turkestan would retain an independent state.\n\nThe Russian response to Shokai's proposal was awaited with bated breath. The fate of Turkestan hung in the balance, and the delicate dance of diplomacy had the potential to avert open conflict or plunge the region into further chaos."

turkestan_railway_crisis.12.t: "Diplomatic Failure"
turkestan_railway_crisis.12.d: "Mustafa Shokai's gamble to seek a diplomatic solution with the Russian Garrison had ended in a chilling failure. Instead of accepting the terms, the Russian authorities, furious at the turn of events, demanded immediate military intervention to resolve the conflict. Tensions escalated rapidly, and the situation spiraled into a catastrophic crisis, more severe than anyone could have imagined. The Russian Garrison, far from being disarmed or coaxed into cooperation, faced a grim fate. They were not only disarmed but subjected to a brutal and relentless assault.\n\nThe international community was aghast at the horrifying events unfolding in Turkestan. Reports of the massacre of the Russian Garrison reached the highest diplomatic echelons, sparking outrage and condemnation from foreign governments. The incident had brought Turkestan to the brink of a full-scale war with Russia, a situation the nation could ill afford amidst its internal strife. Yet, the situation remained precarious, as Madamin-Bek had seized control of the entire Central Asian Railway, a strategic asset that could tip the scales of power in his favor. As the crisis deepened and the world watched, Turkestan now stood on the precipice of an uncertain and perilous future."
turkestan_railway_crisis.12.a: "It was dire to count on Russia."

turkestan_railway_crisis.13.t: "A Fragile Peace"
turkestan_railway_crisis.13.d: "In a stunning turn of events, Russia agreed to the terms laid out by Mustafa Shokai and signed the historic Tashkent Accords. The agreement, celebrated by some as a path to peace and stability, would have profound implications for Turkestan's future.\n\nUnder the terms of the accords, the Turkestan National Guard maintained its neutrality but offered discreet support to the Russian Garrison. This clandestine alliance, conducted behind the scenes, dealt a severe blow to Madamin-Bek's forces. As Madamin-Bek found himself losing ground, his once-loyal followers began to question his leadership. Faced with mounting pressure, Madamin-Bek was ultimately forced to abandon Tashkent. His flight from the city marked a significant decline in his popularity and influence, leaving a void that Shokai's government was quick to fill. As part of the treaty, the Russian Garrison, citing solidarity with the \"legitimate government of Turkestan\", laid down their weapons and prepared to withdraw from Turkestan. The New Tashkent, which had been a focal point of turmoil, was now freed from the Garrison's control, opening the way for Shokai's forces to take the city.\n\nWhile the populace celebrated this apparent display of Shokai's strength, the situation was far more complex. The Russian government's influence and pressure on Turkestan had grown significantly as a result of the accords. Mustafa Shokai found himself in a precarious position, navigating a delicate balance of power as Turkestan's internal and external dynamics continued to evolve."
turkestan_railway_crisis.13.a: "At least we have secured our positions."

turkestan_railway_crisis.14.t: "The Unfolding Railway War"
turkestan_railway_crisis.14.d: "As Mustafa Shokai hesitated to intervene in the escalating crisis, the situation in Turkestan took an ominous turn. The absence of government action emboldened Madamin-Bek and, unchecked, he launched a full-scale operation to assert his dominance over New Tashkent. Under the cover of darkness, Madamin-Bek's forces, bolstered by his newfound alliance with the Turkestan Military Organisation, swiftly seized control of Tashkent. The strikes that had paralyzed the Central Asian Railway were brutally crushed, with many striking workers and ERK supporters arrested, injured, or forced into hiding. ERK's leadership declared that they would continue their fight from the shadows.\n\nEven more concerning was the fate of the Russian Garrison. Isolated and disarmed, they found themselves at the mercy of Madamin-Bek's forces. A tense standoff ensued, with Madamin-Bek's troops holding the garrison hostage, effectively preventing them from reestablishing control.\n\nAs word of the \"Railway War\" spread, Shokai's government found itself in a dire predicament. The Russian government issued stern warnings, demanding immediate action to resolve the crisis and secure the safety of the Russian Garrison. Shokai faced a stark choice: cooperating with the Russian government and seeking a joint effort to suppress Madamin-Bek's forces and regain control over New Tashkent. This option, however, risked further alienating Turkestan's populace and could lead to a loss of sovereignity.\n\nAlternatively, Shokai can decide to leave the fate of the Russian Garrison in Madamin-Bek's hands. This would avoid direct confrontation with Russia but risked strengthening Madamin-Bek's position as a dominant force in Turkestan.\n\nThe clock was ticking, and Shokai's choice would have profound consequences for the future of Turkestan."

Troops were dispatched both to the Ferghana Valley and Tashkent, determined to crush the rival government and assert Shokai's authority. In Ferghana, Madamin-Bek's government structures proved fragile and ill-prepared for such a rapid onslaught. Within days, they crumbled, allowing Shokai's forces to assert control over the region.\n\nThe battle for Tashkent, however, was more formidable. Madamin-Bek's forces had entrenched themselves in the city, and a tense standoff ensued. Shokai's government, with the backing of the Turkestan National Guard, coordinated a multi-pronged assault alongside the Russian Garrison, catching Madamin-Bek's forces off guard. After days of intense fighting, Madamin-Bek's forces were overwhelmed. Madamin-Bek himself was arrested and taken into custody. The Turkestan National Guard, led by loyalists to Shokai, swiftly secured the entire city.\n\nBut Shokai had one more surprise in store. With Tashkent now firmly in his grasp, he ordered the Turkestan National Guard to disarm the Russian Garrison, catching them off guard. This move took the Russian Garrison by surprise, leaving them powerless and allowing Shokai's forces to completely subdue the city. With Madamin-Bek's government dismantled and the Russian Garrison disarmed, Shokai had achieved a decisive victory. His rule now extended over much of the territory, and the immediate threat posed by his rivals had been eliminated. At least for now..."

turkestan_railway_crisis.16.d: "Mustafa Shokai's decision to jointly crush Madamin-Bek and liberate the Russian Garrison had far-reaching and disastrous consequences. The plan, while ambitious, would prove to be a catastrophic failure. Russia, grappling with its own challenges, could only offer Shokai formal international \"approval\" for his endeavor, leaving him effectively alone against Madamin-Bek's formidable forces in Tashkent. Shokai's gamble to strike at Madamin-Bek's so-called \"bandit forces\" with the Turkestan National Guard would end in tragedy.\n\nAs the two sides clashed in the streets of Tashkent, it became painfully clear that Shokai's forces were outmatched. They not only lost the street battle but witnessed a horrifying turn of events. Madamin-Bek, seeking to make a bold statement, executed a significant number of the Russian Garrison, leaving only their command as hostages. This ruthless act sent shockwaves through the region. With no other option, the Turkestan National Guard was forced to retreat, leaving Tashkent in the hands of Madamin-Bek's forces. The situation in Turkestan had grown dire, with Madamin-Bek now calling for an open revolt against what he labeled the \"traitors of Turkestan\".\n\nNews of the government's failures and Madamin-Bek's rise to power quickly spread, sparking uprisings and protests in cities across Turkestan. The population, disillusioned with Shokai's leadership, began to rally behind the charismatic figure of Madamin-Bek. Adding to the crisis, the Russians, upon hearing the latest developments, decided to seize all support for Shokai's government, leaving them to their own devices. Turkestan now stood on the brink of a full-scale civil war, its future more uncertain than ever."

While the situation was dire, he refused to intervene militarily, opting for a path of prudence and seeking to prevent further bloodshed. Madamin-Bek's forces had effectively executed much of the Russian Garrison command, sparing only the general staff as hostages. In response, Madamin-Bek declared Shokai's government illegitimate, labeling it \"dead\", and called for open revolt against what he dubbed the \"traitors of Turkestan\".\n\nHowever, his brutal actions were not met with universal support. Many Turkestanis recognized that Shokai had tried to avoid being drawn into the conflict, aiming to prevent unnecessary violence. They believed that Madamin-Bek's decision to execute the Garrison was his own choice, and nobody had forced his hand.\n\nIn this critical moment, the ERK, having suffered from Madamin-Bek's actions as well, declared their loyalty to the Republic and the duly elected government. They denounced Madamin-Bek's radicalism and affirmed their commitment to a peaceful resolution of the crisis. The same position was shared by the Ittifoqi Muslimin, who believed that democracy would still be a much more stable solution, than a civil war.\n\nThe population, torn between two opposing factions, began to reconsider their allegiances. Shokai's government, although weakened, retained a semblance of legitimacy in the eyes of many Turkestanis who desired a peaceful and stable future for their homeland."

As the major hub of the railroad, Tashkent was divided between the New and Old City, with the New City under the control of Russian Garrison as part of our agreements with the government of Turkestan.\n\nUnfortunately for us, the government of Turkestan refused to intervene in the situation, leading to a fierce conflict between the strikers, Garrison and bandit troops of Madamin-Bek, a local warlord from Ferghana valley, who claims to be the legitimate ruler of all Turkestan. The situation quickly descended into complete chaos with lots of victims.

As the influence of the Qadimists gained momentum, it led to the resignation of the first premier, Tynyshpayev, followed by the overthrow of Shokai in February 1918.

This newfound opposition found allies in various quarters. In November 1918, the Fergana Peasant Army, led by Monstrov and comprising volunteer units of peasant settlers, rallied against the Bolsheviks in Jalalabad. In Tashkent, in January 1919, a rebellion orchestrated by the military commissar Osipov resulted in the loss of many lives of Soviet workers.\n\nAs the year progressed, opposition forces united against the Bolsheviks. The Peasant Army, Madamin Bey Mojahedin, and the Semirechye Army Cossacks joined hands, culminating in the formation of the Provisional Fergana Government. The relentless resistance led to the eventual overthrow of Bolshevik power in Turkestan.

Nicknamed the White Guard of Turkestan, the TVO played a significant role in defeating the Bolsheviks during the Turkestan Civil War. The organization received active assistance from foreign intelligence agents, primarily the British, with figures like Wilfred Malleson and agents operating under the guise of foreign diplomatic missions accredited in Tashkent under the Soviet government.\n\nMembers of this underground organization established connections with Ataman Dutov, General Denikin, Alash Orda Kazakhs, the Emir of Bukhara, leaders of Fergana and Turkmen Mujahideen, Transcaspian White Guard forces, and English consuls in Kashgar, Kulja, and Meshed. Konstantin Osipov, a former Bolshevik who staged a rebellion against his own in January 1919, the peasant army of Konstantin Monstrov, and the Madamin-Bek's Mujahideen - all became mere pawns in the cunning game of the Turkestan Military Organization.\n\nThe leader of the organization, Pyotr Kornilov, brother of the Russian military commander Lavr Kornilov, though perished, leaving a power vacuum within the organization. In this void, Osipov and Monstrov, former ideological opponents, joined forces for a common goal, gaining the upper hand.

Despite these efforts, Russia's control over Turkestan proved untenable, leading to the eventual withdrawal of Russian troops from the region. In 1926, Kerensky recognized the independence of the Turkestan Republic, marking a critical turning point in the nation's history.\n\nUnder Mustafa Shokai's leadership as Minister-President, the Turkestan Federal Republic attempted to navigate the complexities of a country grappling with internal problems.

turkestan.50.d: "We have exposed that the Emirate of Bukhara is sponsoring Mujahideen revolt in East Pamir by sending them ammunition and supplies. This is an absolute violation of political stability in the region and direct intervention into our internal affairs. The Kadimists suggest that we should immediately express a note of protest to the Emir and demand him to stop destabilizing our country. The Jadidists, however, suggested to act more resolutely and completely cut all ties with Bukhara, close the borders and brutally suppress the Mujahideen in East Pamir."
turkestan.50.a: "Follow the Kadimist suggestion."
turkestan.50.b: "We should listen to Shokay and cut all ties with Bukhara!"
turkestan.50.c: "Are we sure that the evidence is enough?"

turkestan.51.t: "Note of Protest From Turkestan!"
turkestan.51.d: "The Turkestan Government has expressed a note of protest and accused us of violating stability in the region."
turkestan.51.a: "Who cares?"

turkestan.52.t: "Turkestan Cut All Ties With Us!"
turkestan.52.d: "The Turkestan government has cut all ties with us after exposing that we are secretly supporting the East Pamir insurgency. Moreover, they promised that they will brutally suppress the revolt."
turkestan.52.a: "Damn."

turkestan.55.t: "Rebels Suppressed!"
turkestan.55.d: "We managed to win against the Mujahideen in East Pamir and soon our National Guard has invaded the whole region to put it back under control of our government. The treacherous Kurbashi and their divisions have fled the country to Bukhara. At the same time the Kadimist party, Shuroy-Ulamo has lost much of the popular support for openly supporting the rebellion."
turkestan.55.a: "Peace, finally!"

turkestan.56.t: "National Guard Gives Up!"
turkestan.56.d: "Our national guard was unable to crush the rebels and was forced to retreat, which allowed the Mujahideen to maintain the region under their control. It is said that tomorrow will be a holiday in Bukhara due to the victory of Mujahideen in East Pamir. Moreover, Shuroy-Islamiya has lost much of the popular support, because of our loss."
turkestan.56.a: "Damn."

turkestan.57.t: "Partial Control Over East Pamir"
turkestan.57.d: "We managed to break the defense of the Mujahideen, but we could not establish our full control over the region. Though the 'East Pamir Government' is now in exile in Bukhara, there are still some partisans in the area."
turkestan.57.a: "A great progress, at least."

turkestan.58.t: "National Guard Gives Up!"
turkestan.58.d: "The Turkestan National Guard was unable to crush us and was forced to retreat, allowing us to maintain the region under our control. Tomorrow there will be a holiday in Bukhara and East Pamir due to our victory!"
turkestan.58.a: "This is only the beginning!"

turkestan.59.t: "A Bitter Defeat!"
turkestan.59.d: "The Turkestan National Guard managed to crush us and now they are invading the whole region. Our leaders were forced to flee for Bukhara, which means our complete defeat."
turkestan.59.a: "Damn."

turkestan.60.t: "Meeting of the Military Council: The Situation in the East Pamir"
turkestan.60.d: "To combat the insurgency in the East Pamirs, the Minister-President convened a Military Council composed, so to speak, of high-ranking field leaders, including Madamin-Bek and Konstantin Monstrov, leaders of the now defunct Provisional Fergana Government. Representatives of Shuroy-Ulamo were also present at the Council. It was necessary to figure out how to stop the uprising as quickly as possible.\n\nHaving undergone a series of difficult discussions and debates, there are now two main points of view on how to win this conflict. The first is to mobilize more troops and invade the Eastern Pamirs in large numbers, hoping to outnumber the enemies with weapons and men. This was the option proposed by Madamin-Bek and Shuroy-Ulamo.\n\nThe second is to start their own guerrilla movement against the Mujahideen, infiltrating their fighters into their camp under the cover of loyal followers of the Mujahideen, and then launch a surprise attack from outside as well as inside. This is the tactic followed by the Monstrov."
turkestan.60.a: "We should outnumber them."
turkestan.60.b: "Infiltrate their movement."

turkestan.61.t: "Another Loss"
turkestan.61.d: "Despite we outnumbered the Mujahideen, they still managed to hold the region, meaning that this is another our defeat. With the elections upcoming, it seems that we cannot spare more resources to defeat them."
turkestan.61.a: "That's awful."

turkestan.62.t: "Mujahideen Defeated!"
turkestan.62.d: "Due to our tactic of infiltration, we managed to break through the rebel's defence, while they were preoccupied with the resistance inside the region. We managed to get crush the revolt, finally bringing peace to East Pamir."
turkestan.62.a: "Great!"

turkestan.5.t: "Young Khiva Victory"
turkestan.5.d: "There have been reports about the liberalisation of Khiva's regime. It seems that Mujahideen have lost their power in Khiva, becoming a serious threat to Mujahideen and Kadimist influence. It seems that now Shuroy-Ulamo can only rely on Bukhara."
turkestan.5.a: "The Khanate has fallen."

turkestan.6.t: "The Regime Changed in Bukhara"
turkestan.6.d: "We have just received reports that our neighbor and rival in the Emirate of Bukhara have undergone a dramatic shift in their political climate. The Emir seems to finally given up and the rule of Mujahideen in Bukhara has ended."
turkestan.6.a: "Finally, a friendly regime in Bukhara."
turkestan.6.b: "We're the last true political force of the Steppes."

trk_elections.1.t: "The Upcoming Elections"
trk_elections.1.d: "The upcoming elections of 1936 are going to be one of the most uncertain in the history of the Turkestan Republic. On the one hand, incumbent president Mustafa Shokay, who has been in office since 1917, is the representative of the Jadidist party, Shuroy-Islamiya. He's a kazakh and seeks further cooperation with the Alash Autonomy, a position that has garnered him much hate among the common Kyrgyz and Uzbek population of the region; he is seen as a Russian lapdog and an Alash puppet. On the other hand, there is the candidate from the Kadimist party, Shuroy-Ulamo, Katta Ergash. He is a supporter of traditional values, and seeks cooperation with the Emirate of Bukhara. He also relies on Ottoman and German support and wishes to make Turkestan a part of a single pan-Islamic state.\n\nHowever, with some of the region under control of Mujahideen, the unrest can spread across the nation, and the fate of democracy is uncertain."
trk_elections.1.a: "Challenging."

trk_elections.2.t: "President's Speech"
trk_elections.2.d: "Mustafa Shokay, incumbent president, has delivered a speech just before the elections. He promised further cooperation with Russia and the Alash Autonomy, increasing representation of other nations in the parliament and openly denouncing the Kadimists and the Mujahideen, who, as he said, want to destroy the Republic and democracy and integrate our state into the Emirate of Bukhara. He added that the citizens of the Turkestan Republic should do everything they can to preserve the independence of the country."
trk_elections.2.a: "He's promising the same thing every time."

trk_elections.3.t: "Political Crisis in Russia"
trk_elections.3.d: "The assassination of Kerensky appeared to be a surprise for Mustafa Shokay. Now he cannot count on Russian assistance, and one of his main promises during his presidency cannot be implemented. This is a serious shock for his campaign and it seems that nothing can stop Shuroy-Ulamo from finally winning the elections."
trk_elections.3.a: "What will he do now?"

trk_elections.4.t: "ERK Agitation"
trk_elections.4.d: "The Socialist Party of Turkestan 'ERK' has launched a large-scale agitation for their party, calling for workers' and dehkans' solidarity against our rule. Why generally our allies in first afterwar years, the scattered anti-Bolshevik socialist groups and organisations soon united into a single party, led by Torokul Dzhanuzakov and Nazir Torekulov, former members of the Russian Left SR party, later joined by Ahmet Zeki Velidi Togan, a Bashkir nationalists, who left the Russia for Turkestan due to his panturkist views and Russification policies.\n\nNow, united, the ERK is ready to participate in elections to form a third significant force in our political spectrum, challenging both Shuroy-Islamiya and Shuroy-Ulamo.\n\nWhile generally Shokay opposed ERK in the previous elections, this time, perhaps, he should find a compromise and form a coalition with them in order to kick Shuroy-Ulamo out of the Mejlis."
trk_elections.4.a: "Interesting"

trk_elections.5.t: "Choosing the Focus"
trk_elections.5.d: "We should choose the regions where we should focus our agitation on. The first choice is to challenge the socialists in urban areas, mainly Tashkent. While this will possibly get us more supporters among the workers, it could also weaken our core electorate in Pishpek and Samarkand, who see socialism as too radical ideology.\n\nOn the other hand, we can focus on Kadimist-majority areas, such as Turkestan and East Pamir. This can weaken the Shuroy-Ulamo positions, but at the same time, we will lose some points against Socialists.\n\nFinally, we can turn to our core regions of Samarkand and Pishpek and hope that this time we will succeed."
trk_elections.5.a: "Focus on Tashkent and other urban areas."
trk_elections.5.b: "Focus on traditionally Kadimist regions."
trk_elections.5.c: "Focus on our core Jadidist regions."

trk_elections.6.t: "Coalition Talks with ERK"
trk_elections.6.d: "Our victory more and more is slipping out of our hands, and it seems that we must start thinking about coalition with ERK. While we have much in common, some of their ideology points are too radical for us, like land and religious reform. However, if we don't try we can lose the elections to Kadimists, who are likely to end any kind of democracy in Turkestan."
trk_elections.6.a: "Start the talks."
trk_elections.6.b: "We shall win alone."

trk_elections.7.t: "Shokay Meets Dzhanuzakov"
trk_elections.7.d: "President Shokay has met with ERK leader, Dzhanuzakov in a historical meeting to start coalition talks between Shuroy-Islamiya and ERK. While there are many differences between the parties, they all share the same hope for Turkestan Democracy. It is unknown if the parties will agree to cooperate, but the first step has already been made.\n\nThe one hot topic on the talks is the Land Reform, which, according to the ERK party programme, should be nationalized, and the agriculture should be collectivized, which is not tolerated by any of the Shuroy-Islamiya members and can greatly dissapoint our liberal supporters.\n\nThe second most important topic is the freedom of strikes and trade unions, which was not under ban, though harshly suppressed by the Government in the previous years."
trk_elections.7.a: "We should try to agree on Land Reform."
trk_elections.7.b: "We should try to agree on Strikes and Trade-Unions."
trk_elections.7.c: "Let's focus on something irrelevant now: Religion and Socialism."

trk_elections.8.t: "Land Reform Debate"
trk_elections.8.d: "Decided to focus on the Land Reform, the talks were indeed hot, with each of the sides evaluating two principled positions where the coalition can exist. The ERK has suggested either to nationalize all the land in Turkestan, which will definetely anger most of our supporters, but greatly liberalize the dehkans and workers, or collectivize the agricultural sector. The Shuroy-Islamiya should either agree on one of the principles, or suggest a compromise: voluntary collectivisation. While also not very popular among Shuroy-Islamiya voters, the voluntary collectivisation can be really the way out of the crisis."
trk_elections.8.a: "We agree on nationalization of land."
trk_elections.8.b: "We agree on collectivization of agriculture."
trk_elections.8.c: "We agree only on voluntary collectivisation."
trk_elections.8.e: "We don't agree - leave the talks!"

trk_elections.9.t: "Turkestan National Union Announced!"
trk_elections.9.d: "With negotiations passing smoothly, Shuroy-Islamiya and ERK have agreed on voluntary collectivisation and created a coalition that will likely succeed in the upcoming elections and win against Kadimists. The Turkestan National Union, receiving the title after the ERK's initial party name, should become the favorite or the democracy has no chance."
trk_elections.9.a: "Great victory for our fragile democracy!"

trk_elections.10.t: "Coalition Talks Disrupted!"
trk_elections.10.d: "The negotiations were disrupted by the unwilingness of any of the two parties to cooperate. While the ERK's position is clear, the Shuroy-Islamiya, which is in a weaker position, is risking to lose the elections and our fragile democracy can fall."
trk_elections.10.a: "Disaster!"

trk_elections.11.t: "Trade-Unions Debate"
trk_elections.11.d: "Decided to focus on the strikes and trade-unions state, the talks were indeed hot, with each of the sides evaluating their principled positions where the coalition can exist. The ERK has suggested that the right to strike and create trade unions should be guaranteed by the government and the rights of dehkans and workers should be respected. While Shuroy-Islamiya can agree on this point, though losing some support from more conservative-minded electorate, it seems there is no compromise available for this point. If we don't agree on this topic, we can fail coalition talks."
trk_elections.11.a: "Guarantee the right to strike and form trade unions."
trk_elections.11.b: "That's enough - leave the talks!"

trk_elections.12.t: "Turkestan National Union Announced!"
trk_elections.12.d: "With negotiations passing smoothly, Shuroy-Islamiya and ERK have agreed on guaranteeing the right to strike and form trade unions, thus creating a coalition that will likely succeed in the upcoming elections and win against Kadimists. The Turkestan National Union, receiving the title after the ERK's initial party name, should become the favorite or the democracy has no chance."
trk_elections.12.a: "Great victory for our fragile democracy!"

trk_elections.13.t: "Election Day!"
trk_elections.13.d: "The day of elections has come and now we should provide safety to all the voters and check that the election was fair. The most dangerous electoral region is, of course, in Turkestan and East Pamir, where we can risk that the elections can be disrupted by the Mujahideen."
trk_elections.13.a: "Reinforce our south-eastern regions."

trk_elections.14.t: "Mujahideen Block Polling Stations!"
trk_elections.14.d: "As predicted, the Mujahideen troops in Turkestan and East Pamir have blocked the polling stations, preventing the population from exercising their legitimate constitutional right to vote. We should immediately deal with this situation, or else the elections cannot be considered legitimate and valid."
trk_elections.14.a: "Arrest all who block the polling stations!"
trk_elections.14.b: "Cancel the elections until we deal with them!"
trk_elections.14.c: "Announce our electoral victory even without Turkestan and East Pamir."

trk_elections.15.t: "Chaos in East Pamir"
trk_elections.15.d: "We managed to 'liberate' the polling station from Mujahideen in Turkestan, our capital city, but not in the East Pamir, where the Mujahideen have already blocked most of the polling station and declared the elections unconstitutional and illegitimate. If we don't do something now, we can anger the population."
trk_elections.15.a: "That's enough. Send National Guard to East Pamir!"
trk_elections.15.b: "Cancel the elections until we deal with them!"
trk_elections.15.c: "Announce our electoral victory even without East Pamir."

trk_elections.16.t: "Elections Postponed!"
trk_elections.16.d: "Due to the unstable situation in East Pamir, the government decided to temporary cancel the elections and postpone them until the unrest is dealt with. However, by trying to save the population's right to vote, we only angered them and showed our weakness. More people are joining the side of the Mujahideen, tired of our fragile democracy and the Kadimists have as well announced their support for the East Pamir rioters, completely debasing our political system!"
trk_elections.16.a: "Catastrophic!"

trk_elections.17.t: "Clashes in East Pamir"
trk_elections.17.d: "With our National Guard entering East Pamir, the armed clashes between them and Mujahideen bursted out. Moreover, the Kadimists announced their support for the Mujahideen, leaving us without support of almost half of the Mejlis. President Shokay, while he is still president, should do something, probably even enacting the martial law to save democracy."
trk_elections.17.a: "National Guard will deal with the unrest."
trk_elections.17.b: "Enact the martial law."

trk_elections.18.t: "Part of the National Guard Defects!"
trk_elections.18.d: "Part of the National Guard, being formed and raised by the Mujahideen has defected to their side, leaving us with minority of forces in the region. It seems that the catastrophe cannot be avoided... we should enact martial law and get ready for the worst."
trk_elections.18.a: "Enact the martial law!"

trk_elections.19.t: "Martial Law Enacted!"
trk_elections.19.d: "President Shokay has assumed his emergency powers and enacted the martial law in East Pamir in order to deal with the political crisis. The curfew was installed, however, not only in East Pamir, but in every region of our country with President Shokay seeking for support of anybody to secure the democracy."
trk_elections.19.a: "Ask for Alash support."
trk_elections.19.b: "We need support of Russia."
trk_elections.19.c: "Join forces with Bukhara."
trk_elections.19.e: "We should rely on ourselves."

trk_elections.20.t: "Support Democratic Forces of Turkestan?"
trk_elections.20.d: "Due to the political crisis and disrupted elections in Turkestan, its government and President Shokay has asked us for help. We may send our troops to the East Pamir region to help the Turkestan National Guard suppress the Mujahideen revolt and, perhaps, save the last one stable democratic regime in Turkestan."
trk_elections.20.a: "Send our support."
trk_elections.20.b: "We'll stay out of this."
trk_elections.20.c: "Their autonomy would be their payment."

trk_elections.21.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government agreed to support us in our fight against reactionary Mujahideen in East Pamir. Perhaps, together, we have more chances to succeed."

trk_elections.23.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Submission!"
trk_elections.23.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government demanded our submission. They stated that in response for us becoming their autonomy, they would send us all the support and forcefully end our instability."

trk_elections.23.b: "We have no other choice."

trk_elections.24.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused Autonomy"

trk_elections.24.a: "They will regret this."

trk_elections.25.t: "Mujahideen Crushed!"
trk_elections.25.d: "Despite part of our National Guard defected, we managed to crush most of the Mujahideen troops with the help of our neighbors. The others had fled the region for Afghanistan, opening up the East Pamir for our loyalists. It seems that we have avoided the Civil War."
trk_elections.25.a: "President Shokay holds on."

trk_elections.26.t: "Civil Strife in Turkestan"
trk_elections.26.d: "Despite our efforts to end the crisis, it had only escalated more just for our government to realize that people are mobilizing against our rule.\n\nThe Socialists were able to successfully seize control of a major industrial center, Tashkent, and also fixed their positions in the Ak-Mechet. Part of the National Guard, loyal to the president, was able to defend Samarkand and Pishpek, although it turned out to be divided, and the Mujahideen were firmly entrenched in the East Pamir.\n\nThere were some clashes between the opponents, the main goal of the attackers was to seize key infrastructure and railways. Despite the complexity of the situation, as a result of the chaos, the strengths and weaknesses of each side quickly became clear. It is possible that the echoes of this civil strife will hinder the new government for a long time, but already at this stage the winner was clearly visible."
trk_elections.26.a: "Shokay Loyalists manage to suppress the uprisings."

trk_elections.27.d: "Despite the fact that elections were not held in the East Pamir, the government has announced them as concluded with Shuroy-Islamiya winning the majority. However, many citizens are dissappointed in the elections and don't see us as the legitimate ones. Without dealing with the Mujahideen, it seems that we won't have enough political power and legitimacy until all regions of our country are under our full control."

turkestan.8.d: "The [UZB.GetName] has recently had to deal with socialist insurgency in the Karshi region. Luckily for them, the uprising was crushed, but unfortunately for us, Fayzulla Khodjaev has crossed the border and is now hiding somewhere in Samarkand. Even now as we speak, that marxist devil snakes his way through our lands, untethered by morals or law."
turkestan.8.a: "Find him and arrest him!"
turkestan.8.b: "We welcome all victims of the Emirate regime"

turkestan.9.t: "Socialist Insurgency in Ak-Mechet"
turkestan.9.d: "It was stupid to think that the socialist movement in Turkestan was weak. Formally, the Union of Muslim Workers is represented by Nazir Torekulov in Turkestan, but he's unlikely to be a big threat. However, with the arrival of Mukhitdinov, he has managed to raise an uprising in the industrial region of Tashkent."
turkestan.9.a: "Send there troops."

turkestan.10.t: "Mukhitdinov Proclaims Workers' Republic in Tashkent"
turkestan.10.d: "Abdulkadyr Mukhitdinov has proclaimed a socialist republic in Tashkent. While the idea is seemingly nonsensical and absurd, it has still occurred nonetheless. He's still a threat and he's supported by many proletarians in both Tashkent and our borders, we must remain vigilant."
turkestan.10.a: "Liquidate the unrest at any cost."
turkestan.10.b: "Ask Bukhara for help."

turkestan.11.t: "Turkestan Asks for Help"
turkestan.11.d: "The government of Turkestan has asked us to intervene in Tashkent and help to liquidate the socialist unrest in the border region. If we were to help, we could finally remove this marxist taint once and for all, or we can let the rebels be and have them sow discord in our historic enemies."
turkestan.11.a: "Sure, we will send a force to aid in crushing the rebels."
turkestan.11.b: "A destabilized Turkestan is better for us."

turkestan.12.t: "Bukhara Intervenes in Tashkent."
turkestan.12.d: "The government of [UZB.GetNameDef] has agreed to intervene in Tashkent. Our joint forces have liquidated the unrest with their joint strength. Luckily, Mukhitdinov was also murdered in the crossfire and the uprising was finally suppressed."

turkestan.15.d: "The protesters not only managed to repulse our forces, but many of our soldiers refused to fire on the protesters, instead joining their ranks. The uprising was supported in Pishkek as well, and it became too much for our regime to bear. The revolutionaries, spewing forth from Tashkent, seized administrative buildings in Pishkek and Osh, and Mukhitdinov arrived in the capital. Later that day he proclaimed the People's Republic of Turkestan."

To be more precise, disputed territories.\n\nThe [FROM.GetAdjective] government since its independence in 1918 has claimed the territory of Aralsk and the whole region of Zhetisu, from the Verniy city up to the lake Balkhash.\n\nIf we will be able to agree on disputed territories and finally end this topic, the relations between our countries will definetely improve.\n\nHowever, we can just leave the conference and leave this territories under our control, having worsened the relationship, but at least showing that we will fight for every Kazakh."

turkestan.23.t: "Verniy Conference"
turkestan.23.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to hold the conference and discuss disputed territories.\n\nIn fact, there is no much we can ask for. The most important our claim is the whole region of Zhetisu, which covers large amount of territory from Verniy city to the lake Balkhash. It is hard to believe that the Kazakhs will give up the whole region, where the majority of population is Kazakh. In response, however, we can guarantee their independence, the represenation of the Kazakh population in the Mejlis and even look forward to uniting our states into a single federation.\n\nThe second our claim is the north-eastern shore of the Aral Sea with a little town of Aralsk. Our government believes it to become a large sea port one day, moreover, located at the Central Asian Railway.\n\nThere is always a chance that the Kazakh government won't agree on any our term, but we will try to appease them as we can."
turkestan.23.a: "Zhetisu in exchange for guarantees."

We should transfer the whole region of Zhetisu to them and in exchange we will guarantee independence of each other, sign military alliance and the [FROM.GetAdjective] government guarantees the representation of all Kazakh population.\n\nWhile this suggestion can seem ridiculuos at first, if we really want to unite our countries into a single state one day - this can be the first step towards it."
turkestan.24.a: "What? Truly ridiculuos!"

Moreover, they have suggested to hold the referendum themselves, which makes no sense. It seems that the [FROM.GetAdjective] government just does not want to recognize the results and are rudely interfering into people's will."

TRK_lasting_political_crisis_desc: "For nearly two decades now, the Turkestan is ruled separately by two governments: the Federal Government, a coalition between the Jadidists and Qadimists in a weak balance under the leadership of Mustafa Shokai, and the Provisional Ferghana Government, under the leadership of Madamin-Bek. While the Madamin-Bek's government has no real authority over the majority of Turkestan's territory, he's supported by some more radical groups, such as Korşirmat's Mujahideen and Monstrov's Peasant Army.

#1. Having a national culture and living as an independent nation should be the basis of life. This is the dream of all nations. Our goal is to make Turkestan independent and nationalize the government. A nation is based on the unity of language, religion, culture, literature, and tradition.
#2. In free Turkestan, the state structure and administration is a republic, and the basis of power is established by the democratically elected assembly of the nation, or in regions and cities, the region and city assemblies (zemstvo).
#3. The members of the central government will be appointed by the president of the Republic, and the heads of the regions will be appointed by the central government, based on the approval of the national assembly. The chairpersons of regional and city office meetings will be elected at this meeting itself. The procedure for the election of the National Assembly, the Chairman of the Republic, and the regional assemblies will be determined by the first congress of independent Turkestan.
#4. The non-Turkish minority in Turkestan will also enjoy cultural rights. The Turkic peoples should act with one accord to revive the culture of Turkestan.
#5. The national government of Turkestan will rely on the national soldier of Turkestan; military service is compulsory.
#6. In order to maintain internal peace, regional authorities will organize local police, and this association will depend on the national law associations of the country.
#7. Freedom of conscience will be fully ensured in the country. Free management of religious worship and customs will be ensured by the state. No other religious spies are allowed to operate in the country.
#8. Freedom of the press and publication and individual freedom will be ensured by the basic laws of the state.
#9. The main tax of the country will be collected depending on the income. Inheritance will also be taxed. In Turkestan, all kinds of taxes from the old times will be abolished.
#10. Land, underground and surface resources, forests, basins shall become state property. Land will be given to farmers (poor farmers) as private property.
#11. Individuals do not decide the issue of land and water sale by mutual agreement. Such work will be managed by the state. The right to grant land will be determined by law according to local conditions.
#12. The freedom of Turkestan is realized only on the basis of economic independence. Therefore, we will try to ensure that Turkestan's economic relations with other neighboring countries stand on their feet and develop more and more on the basis of the current structure.
#13. The basis of the land issue in Turkestan is water. Therefore, all the strength of the nation will be spent on providing water to the people and improving their lives. Great importance will be attached to the regulation of the work of the water department.
#14. The most important issue for the Kazakh, Kyrgyz and Turkmen peoples in Turkestan is the transition of nomadic peoples to a settled life. This problem will be solved by making new large constructions on the banks of large, swampy oases. Turkestan will not accept immigrants from Turkic peoples other than Muslims.
#15. The issue of workers in Turkestan depends on the growth of national industry in this country. Working conditions of the unemployed, working hours, working conditions of children and wives, insurance and other issues will be regulated along the lines of advanced countries.
#16. Full independence and equal rights for everyone in the matter of justice. Everyone, regardless of religion and worldview, will be protected by modern laws.
#17. In the field of education, incomplete, primary education opportunities will be created. The citizens of the country have the right to open private schools without conflicting with the state's interests.
#18. First of all, professional schools will be established in Turkestan. Importance will be given to sending students to Europe.
#19. Cultural monuments created over the centuries in Turkestan, which is the center of ancient culture, will be protected. They will serve the growth of national culture.

tashkent_rail_desc: "§gAsosiy temir yoʻl ustaxonalari, better known as Main Railroad Workshops, was established in 1900 in order to construct railroads and repair locomotives for the Central Asian Railway. The armed troops of the workers of Railroad Workshops played a defining role in establishing Soviet power in Tashkent in October 1917, but were suppressed during the Osipov Mutiny in January 1919. After the war, the factory was transfered to Russia, and since then was used by Russia in order to control the railways of Turkestan. Since 1934, a steel foundry was established. The plant is still an epicentre of both the Russian influence and socialist sentiments."
