A former member of the Russian syndicalist PLSR party, he seeks to industrialize the country, create Trade Unions and establish Worker's paradise. The third party is the socialist wing of the Young Turkestan Party, led by Usmon Khodja. While he was a member of the Young Bukhara Party, he's views are quite far from liberal.

However, they still have some differences, so that is why the party has divided into two separate camps on the ballot-paper.\n\nThe main candidates are Socialists, Liberals and Conservatives.

TRK_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the Russian Civil War, the Central Asian region was left in chaos, desolated by feud and famine. Bukhara, led by Emir Mohammed Alim Khan, has managed to overcome the difficulties, but at the cost of internal stability. Various groups are breaking country apart, but they all want the same. Firstly, power and secondly, to unite the Turkestan into a single state."
KYR_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The republic of Kokand is has survived the Russian Civil War mainly with the help of Alash and the Whites. Today Kokand is the only independent democracy in the region, trying to maintain its position and restrain reactionary forces in the country. If Turkestan is united once, perhaps it will be a Central Asian Democracy."
UZB_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The existence of Khanate of Khiva has been more or less guaranteed by its stronger neighbour of Bukhara. Since 1918 the Khanate was ruled by a military dictator, Vizier Junaid-Khan. But his health becoming worse and worse with country risking a chance of ceasing to exist without its charismatic leader."
