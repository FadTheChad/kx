The main idea behind the creation of such a party was a response to Russian colonialism and the idea that the national liberation movement of Turkestan did not end with the establishment of the Turkestan Republic, but was suppressed by pro-Russian forces - the Turkestan Military Organization, the Peasant Army and the government of Mustafa Shokay. The party's program, largely inspired by the ideas of the left SRs, seeks to build a just national Turkic state for the dehkans and workers of Turkestan.§!"

The program was dominated by conservative views on domestic affairs and women's issues. Although the Ittifoqi Muslimin does not have a clear hierarchical party structure, the generally recognized leader is the head of the Tashkent section of the party, Sherali Lapin, who also serves as party leader in the Khalq Majlisi of Turkestan.

### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_MUSTAFA_SHOKAY_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! December 25th, 1890, in Aulie-tarangil, Syr-Darya Oblast, Turkestan General-Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Born into the esteemed lineage of a Kazakh aristocratic family, Mustafa Shokay emerged from the small aul of Aulie-tarangil, where the prosperity of his family was measured by the abundance of livestock. His mother, Bakty, a descendant of the illustrious Batu Khan, played a pivotal role in shaping Mustafa's intellectual prowess. Under her guidance, he mastered Kazakh, Arabic, and Persian. Guided by a local mullah, young Mustafa began his journey into the Islamic realm at the tender age of five. Devoted to his Islamic roots, Mustafa Shokay emerged as a democrat untouched by socialist fervor. With his fine nature, he epitomized a politician for peace, a statesman who cherished discussions and valued diverse perspectives. Some say that this idealism of the young man has faded after 16 years of attempts to lead the nation to a state of peace and unity - that Mustafa has casted colt's teeth, and his constant atempts to strike a balance between Jadidism and Qadimism, unity and diversity, autonomy and independence are just a clear sign he has become a pragmatist and a skillful diplomat. One thing is unclear - will the tranquil reformer he has been all these years save the country?"
POLITICS_TOROQUL_JANUZAKOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1893, in Taldy-Bulaq, Syr-Darya Oblast, Turkestan General-Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Toroqul Januzakov, born into the privileged feudal class of the Northern Kyrgyz people, enjoyed the benefits of a privileged upbringing that included access to quality education. His journey into the turbulent waters of Central Asian politics began as a translator in the Turkestan General-Governor's administration, where he engaged with the leading minds of the Russian intelligentsia. Active in the Central Asian revolt of 1916, Toroqul emerged as a prominent leader in the Kyrgyz-populated regions. His commitment to forging a new path continued in 1917 when he aligned himself with the Turkestan Soviet Republic. On his initiative, the Commission on Refugee Affairs was established, focused on supporting those affected by the 1916 uprising. Toroqul's advocacy secured substantial financial and material resources from post-revolutionary Russia to aid poor participants and facilitate the return of refugees from Xinjiang. As the chairman, Januzakov also played a pivotal role in investigating instances of Russian chauvinism's brutality toward the local Kyrgyz population. Notably, his efforts led to the execution of the perpetrators responsible for the horrific massacre of 537 unarmed Kyrgyz individuals in Belovodskoye during the 1916 uprising.\n\nEducated and intellectually astute, Toroqul began to question the alignment of the Turkestan Soviet leaders with the cause of national liberation. Recognizing the disconnect between their goals and genuine liberation, coupled with a realization that the ethnic Russian leadership was not fostering liberation but perpetuating exploitation, Toroqul Januzakov joined the Mujahideen movement against the Bolsheviks. Between 1919 and 1920, Toroqul participated in the movement alongside prominent figures like Parpi, Korşirmat and Madamin-Bey. Simultaneously, Toroqul delved into scientific research, collecting folklore and conducting archeographic and ethnographic studies.\n\nPost-civil war victory, Toroqul Januzakov reunited with Akhmetzaki Velidi, a comrade since 1914, to establish the ERK socialist party. This collaboration marked the beginning of a significant chapter in Turkestan's political landscape, setting the stage for the emergence of the largest socialist association in the region, that eventually came to power, bringing Januzakov to a long-awaited position of nation's Minister-President."
POLITICS_TURAR_RYSKULOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! December 26th, 1894, in Besagash, Semirechye Oblast, Turkestan General-Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Born into the nomadic herder Shymyr clan of the Kazakh Dulat tribe, Turar Ryskulov emerged as a prominent leader within the Turkestani socialist movement. Childhood friends with Toroqul Januzakov, Turar's journey began at the Merke Russian-Indigenous boarding school, where he and Toroqul studied together. After graduating from the Pishpek agricultural school in 1914, Turar continued his studies in Tashkent. In the summer of 1916, as the national-liberation uprising ignited in the Kazakh steppe, Turar Ryskulov left his studies to return to the village of Merke in Aulie-ata district. Although arrested by the tsarist administration during the uprising, Ryskulov was released due to the absence of evidence against him.\nAfter the February Revolution of 1917, Turar returned to Merke and was elected as the deputy chairman of the executive committee of the Aulie-ata district council. In April 1918, Turar dedicated his efforts to alleviating famine, regulating relations between Russians and Kazakhs, and promoting local representation in councils. Turar's leadership extended to organizing public catering facilities, feeding up to 20 thousand Kazakhs near Aulie-ata. Despite the challenges of famine, he focused on local initiatives and became People's Commissar of Health Care of the Turkestan Soviet Republic in September 1918. Tasked with fighting hunger, Ryskulov demanded the creation of a special organization, leading to the formation of a Central Commission, of which he became chairman.\n\nThe Soviet Republic's collapse prompted Ryskulov to distance himself from the Bolsheviks, emphasizing his local efforts to save the people. Forging a close alliance with Toroqul Januzakov, Turar Ryskulov transitioned into the ERK party after the Turkestan Civil War, becoming Januzakov's closest associate and deputy. Known for his intelligence, character, and pan-Turkist position, Turar Ryskulov remains respected and popular both in Semirechye and Turkestan."
POLITICS_FAYZULLA_KHOJAEV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1896, in Bukhara, Emirate of Bukhara\n§YPolitical Career:§! Fayzulla Hojaev was born in Bukhara in the wealthy family of Uzbek millionaire merchants - one of the noble families of Bukhara - Qasim Sheikh's. He learned the Russian language on his own and studied in Moscow, also visited Germany during his business trip. Since 1913 he was involved in the Jadidist movement and became one of the leaders of the Young Bukhara party. He was one of the organizers of the demonstration in support of \"Manifesto\" of Emir Alim-khan with the announcement of democratic reforms. However, the demonstration was dispersed and Fayzulla was forced to flee from Bukhara. At the beginning of the 1917 Bolshevik Putsch in Russia, as a representative of the Revolutionary Committee, he participated in the so-called \"Kolesov events\" - a rebellion against the Emir of Bukhara. After the defeat of the uprising he fled to Turkestan and was sentenced to death by the Emir's government. On the way to Moscow he was arrested by the government of Ataman Dutov and imprisoned in the Orenburg prison. Receiving amnesty from Kerensky's government, he came to Tashkent, where he organized a bureau of Young Bukhara Revolutionaries, together with Usman Hoja and established ties with the revolutionary underground in Bukhara and supplied it with revolutionary literature.\n\nAfter the moderate wing of Young Bukhara was crushed in Bukhara, Fayzulla decided to act - and succeeded. With the fall of Emir's power, he managed to consolidate his position as the nation's first Prime-Minister. He is willing to radically change the country, that has seen little to no change reform for several centuries. Fayzulla is often called the \"Lenin of the Uzbeks\", though it is hard to tell whether this is a compliment or a curse. A small, wiry, and full of consuming energy, he enjoyed life, and could laugh gaily beneath a crushing load of work. He knows his people, is a great orator, and is much loved."
POLITICS_MUNAWWAR_ANDURRASHIDKHAN_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1878, in Tashkent, Syr-Darya Oblast, Turkestan General-Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidhan was born into an intelligent Tajik family, and his rise from Quran reciter to a prominent figure in Turkestan politics was a testament to his unwavering commitment to reform and independence. In his early years, Munawwar devoted himself to mastering the science of recitation and Tajweed under the tutelage of Usman Domla, a renowned teacher of his time. He studied in the Yunuskhon madrasa in Tashkent and then in a madrasa in Bukhara. Although he did not complete his studies there, he returned to Tashkent and immersed himself in the role of imam and teacher. He founded the first reformed elementary school in Tashkent, which was the beginning of his contribution to the Jadidist movement. Munawwar Abdurrashidhan's activities were not limited to education and journalism: he was active in political activities, advocating the study of European commerce, industry and science and denouncing spiritual backwardness. His stand against the colonial policies of Tsarism led to numerous arrests, emphasizing his dedication to the cause. The far-sighted leader played a key role in the Sho'roi Islamiyya organization, and after the war he co-founded the Milliy Ittihod party. His support for Turkestan's autonomy in 1917 reflected his lifelong dream of seeing his homeland independent.\n\nHowever, in recent years there has been a divergence between Munawwar Abdurrashidhan's vision and that of Mustafa Shokay, the head of the party. With Shokay ousted and a minister-president in place, Munawwar faces perhaps his greatest challenge yet: maintaining unity in an increasingly unstable country struggling with incipient democracy. The delicate balance between tradition and modernity, independence and cooperation now rests on Munawwar's shoulders."
POLITICS_SHERALI_LAPIN_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1868, in Qogalikol, Syr-Darya Oblast, Turkestan General-Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! The life and path of Sherali Lapin epitomizes a lifelong commitment to preserving Islamic values in the face of societal change. Sherali Lapin received a brilliant education and had a successful career: he graduated from the Turkestan teacher's seminary and worked in the profession as a teacher of Russian language, and then entered St. Petersburg to study law and opened an law office there. Lapin worked in the Samarqand regional court, and also accompanied on trips of high officials: the commander of the troops of the Turkestan Military District, the Minister of Railways of the Russian Empire. After his rejection as a candidate for the State Duma, Lapin engaged in scientific activity, participated in the compilation of dictionaries and delved into the study of historical monuments and folklore.\n\nThe revolutionary tide of 1917 brought Lapin to the leadership of the Sho'roi Ulamo party, which was a turning point in his life. After witnessing the defeat of the Kokand autonomy, he sought the support of Germany and Turkey in the struggle against the Bolsheviks, envisioning a German-Turkish protectorate in Turkestan and visited Berlin. Back in his homeland, Lapin observed the successes of the national liberation movement. In the face of the new rule of Shokay and Milliy Ittihod, Lapin remained a supporter of Qadimism, creating the Ittifoqi-Muslimin movement to unite Islamic traditionalists. His strategic entry into the coalition government with Shokay demonstrated Lapin's acumen, eventually leading him to the position of minister-president of the country."
POLITICS_KATTA_ERGASH_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1882, in Bachkir, Fergana Oblast, Turkestan General-Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Little is known about Ergash-Kurbashi's early years. He served as a religious clergyman in Kokand and preached to 25,000 people during Friday prayers. Mullah Ergash participated in the siege of Kokand and fled to Bachkir after the fall of Turkestan autonomy. Ergash formed the first anti-Soviet resistance group, known as the Mirshabs. In the spring of 1918, all Fergana leaders recognized his leadership, and he became popular among the people. During the spring and fall of 1918, Ergash emerged victorious in all battles against the Red Army in Namangan and Kokand districts. A power struggle for leadership of the Mujahideen ensued between Ergash Bey and Madamin-Bey, resulting in Ergash's defeat and the rise of the Provisional Ferghana Government as the dominant body claiming power in all of Turkestan. Consequently, Madamin Bey led the Ferghana mujahideen in late 1918 and early 1919. After the war, Ergash became the informal leader of the local Turkestan militia as an authoritative Kurbashi. In early 1936, the National Guard was created, and Ergash lost his position. He attempted to ban the Mirshab movement and later seized power in a bloodless coup. Ergash then began transforming Turkestan towards conservatism and Islamism."
#Шерали Лапин родился в ауле Когаликол на территории Сырдарьинской области. Учился в Петровском городском училище, окончил Туркестанскую учительскую семинарию. В 1891 году поступил на юридический факультет Санкт-Петербургского университета. Работал репетитором местных языков в Туркестанской учительской семинарии, получил звание домашнего учителя по предмету "русский язык". Шерали Лапин получил блестящее образование и его карьера складывалась удачно: он успешно работал на государственной службе переводчиком. Сначала ЛАпин работал в Самаркандском областном суде, затем сопровождал в поездках высоких чинов: командующего войсками Туркестанского военного округа, министра путей сообщения Российской империи. После выхода в отстатвку поступил на юридический факультет, по окончании открыл в Петербурге адвокатскую контору. Он хотел  стать депутатом в государственную думу от коренного населения Туркестана в 1907 году - известный просветитель Махмудходжа Бехбуди написал уже с сожалением, после того как в результате третьеиюньского переворота Туркестан лишился представительства в думе, что именно такие люди как Лапин должны были быть избраны. Лапин получил отказ от чиновником, и будучи блестящим юристом, он идеально обосновал незаконность отказа - и своё право быть избранным. Однако правительствущий сенат России окончательно отказал ему. Шерали Лапин занялся научной деятельность, разрабатывал словари. В 1910 году Лапин уехал из петербурга обратно в Туркестанский край. Там изучал исторические и архитектурные памятники, фольклор. Исследовал и переводил на русский язык арабские надписи на мавзолее Тамерлана и других мемориальных комплексах. Когда в 1917 году в России произойдёт революция, одну из политических партий Туркестана, Шурои-Уламо, возглавит именно Шерали Лапин. После разгрома Кокандской автономии, Лапин уезжает в Бухару с целью добиться выступления её армии против Советов, однако это ему не удаётся. Он тайно приезжает в Ташкент и обращается здесь за помощью в Германскую комиссию военно- и гражданских пленных, которая снабдила его необходимыми документами для поездки в Москву. Добравшись до Москвы, Лапин с помощью немецкого генерального консула принял турецкое гражданство и выехал в Петербург, а оттуда через Псков отправился в Германию и 20 сентября 1918 г. прибыл в Берлин. Находясь в Германии, он 25 сентября встречается с представителем политического отдела Генерального Штаба лейтенантом Эльснсром, которого ознакомил с политическим положением в Туркестане, сложившимся после октябрьского переворота, акцентировав свое внимание на деятельности правительства Кокандской автономии. Суть его позиции заключалась в необходимости оказания поддержки антибольшевистскому движению в Туркестане со стороны Германии, а в случае победы Шерали Лапин видел этот край в качестве протектората Германии с монархической формой правления. Германские правительственные круги не спешили с ответом представителю туркестанской оппозиции, несмотря на все его усилия всячески подчеркнуть выгодность германского присутствия в Средней Азии и постоянные заявления о чувствах симпатии, которые питало к немцам местное население. 22 ноября Харальд Козак, обращаясь к фон Бюхнеру по поводу Шерали Лапина, все же счел нужным обратить внимание на него, предположив, что позже, когда для Германии пройдут тяжелые времена, связи, установленные с этим человеком, могут стать весьма ценными. Лапин возвращается на родину, и видит успехи национально-освободительного движения, к концу 1919 года большевистские колонизаторы были изгнаны из Туркестана. Однако, власть переходит к новому правительству, установленному с согласия русских. Реформы Шокая и Миллий-Иттиход позволили им занять доминантное положение в обществе, и лишь к 1930-м годам население стало возвращаться к идеям "улемистов". Шерали Лапин вновь возглавил оппозицию Джадидистам - и так появилось движение Иттифоки-Муслимин, призванное объединить исламских кадимистов и традиционалистов Туркестана. Хаос и бардак, царивший в результате раскола общества, Лапин решил обратить в свою пользу - и таким образом вошёл в коалиционное правительство национального спасения с Шокаем, что лишь увеличило его значимость. 

#Лапин придерживался мнения приглашения на туркестанский престол какого-либо турецкого принца и создания великого туркестанского султаната, где на федеративных началах предполагалось объединить 5 ханств: Ташкентское, Кокандское, Бухарское, Хивинское и Туркменское.
#Например, в законе «О земле» были прописаны такие требования как: «дать мусульманам большую возможность пользоваться государственными и общественными землями, но частную собственность не расхищать». Улемы были сторонниками религиозной структуры, в повседневной жизни поддерживали патриархальный строй, были противниками равноправия женщин
POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_MONSTROV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1874, in Syzran, Simbirsk Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Konstantin Ivanovich Monstrov emerged as a formidable figure, earning the moniker "Jalal-Abad Napoleon" for his leadership during the Turkestan Civil War. With a shrewd gaze from dark eyes beneath thick brows, a prominent nose, and a distinctive Skobelev mustache framing his assertive mouth, Monstrov's presence commanded attention. Originally hailing from Simbirsk province and the son of a lay magistrate, Monstrov's journey led him to Syzran, where he married and raised three children. The pre-revolutionary period saw him as an office clerk and contractor, and by 1914, he owned a significant land plot in the Fergana Valley. When the winds of revolution swept through Turkestan, Monstrov found himself at the helm of the Peasant Army, protecting Russian settlers from Mujahideen raids. Initially aligned with the Soviet authorities and the Red Army, his allegiance shifted due to the Bolshevik government's anti-peasant policies. Faced with attempts to seize land from Russian settlers, Monstrov joined forces with the Mujahideen, particularly Madamin-Bey, in a common struggle against Soviet power. The Peasant Army, under Monstrov's leadership, conducted successful battles, securing a vast territory in Turkestan. The strategic base of operations became the city of Jalal-Abad. Notably, Monstrov's forces, alongside Madamin-Bey detachments, captured the city of Osh. This marked a significant victory in the struggle for control over Turkestan. An equal member of the Provisional Fergana Government, Monstrov played a pivotal role in liberating the region.\n\nPost-war, he refrained from recognizing the authority of the Turkestan Republic, echoing the sentiments of his confederate Madamin-Bey. His focus on the autonomy of Russian settlers and his role in resolving ethnic unrest solidified his position as a key figure in the region. However, beyond his warlord status in Jalal-Abad, Monstrov harbored ambitions that hinted at a broader influence and a desire for a role beyond that of a regional commander. The man with the \"Skobelev mustache\" and memorable countenance had set his sights on a more significant role in the turbulent politics of Turkestan."

turkestan_railway_crisis.1.t: "Main Railroad Worshops Hit By Strikes"
turkestan_railway_crisis.1.d: "In the wake of economic turmoil and political unrest throughout Russia, the Central Asian Railway has been thrown into disarray. The Main Railroad Workshops in Tashkent, a crucial hub for the railway, is now paralyzed due to worker strikes. These strikes were incited by various groups, including the ERK party and Russophone socialist organizations. The situation has become critical, as the Russian Garrison stationed in New Tashkent has found itself isolated from Petrograd due to the disruption of communication lines. The Garrison has urgently requested our assistance in quelling the strikes to restore order and ensure the railway's functionality.\n\nHowever, within our government, there are differing opinions on how to approach this crisis. Our Ittifoqi Muslimin coalition allies, as well as oppositional ERK party members are calling for a bold move to disarm the Russian Garrison and regain control of New Tashkent, asserting our independence and authority. Such a move could have significant consequences for our relations with the Russian government. On the other hand, Madamin-Bey has proposed to disarm the Garrison on his own. While this proposition is seen by Shokay as too radical, potentially bolstering Madamin-Bey's rival government even further, it can be benefitial if we want to put the blame on somebody."

turkestan_railway_crisis.2.d: "As the strikes in Tashkent has reached their peak, the situation became dire and it was the government's choice whether to assist the Russian Garrison, or disarm it, taking the protesters' side. The orders were given, and the Turkestan National Guard was dispatched to Tashkent. Clad in their distinctive uniforms and bearing the red and blue emblems, they entered the city. Mustafa Shokay's government had chosen to prioritize its relationship with Russia, and the consequences of this decision were about to play out. The Turkestan National Guard, armed and ready, moved in to disperse the crowds. The workers resisted, chanting slogans of Turkestan's independence and socialist revolution. But the Guard's orders were clear, and in the end, the strikes were forcibly quelled. The Main Railroad Workshop fell back into the hands of the authorities, as the Russian Garrison resumed control of New Tashkent.\n\nRussia commended our cooperation, but within our nation, a growing sense of resentment began to take root. Qadimists and the ERK party saw us as compromising our autonomy for the sake of foreign interests. Furthermore, this has likely led to strengthening of the Turkestan Military Organisation in Tashkent..."

turkestan_railway_crisis.3.d: "The fragile coalition that held Turkestan together was unraveling, driven by Mustafa Shokay's decision during the worker strikes in Tashkent. As the 'wheedling the Russians' intensified the existing divisions between the Jadidists and Qadimists. The Qadimists, embracing a more traditional stance, broke away. This rupture plunged Turkestan into further chaos, with Qadimist leaders distancing themselves from the coalition they once helped forge. Mustafa Shokay's calculated gamble aimed at balancing Russian interests and internal autonomy backfired. Facing a pivotal choice, the government contemplated drastic measures, with whispers of abandoning democratic institutions for stability and control in the face of mounting chaos."

turkestan_railway_crisis.4.d: "The discontent had ripened into a full-blown crisis. The ERK party seized the moment to launch a revolutionary upheaval. Their call for an all-Turkestan strike resonated from Tashkent to Pishpek, uniting workers across ethnicities against perceived government oppression. The promise of equality and the rejection of Russian settlers' influence drew widespread support. Dehkan peasants, burdened by economic hardships and land inequality, fervently joined the cause. Riots erupted, demanding land reform and an end to their plight. The Turkestan Republic became a battleground of protests and agitation. As news of strikes and riots spread, Mustafa Shokay's government faced a formidable challenge. ERK's coalition, spanning diverse factions, threatened to dismantle the fragile stability painstakingly built."

In a fervent proclamation, Korşirmat advocates for a pan-Islamist Turkestan, united under the principles of Sharia and the Quran. Korşirmat perceives Mustafa Shokay's administration as weak and secular governance, undermining true Islamic values and condemns it. The Mujahideen, gaining substantial support from local communities, pledge to restore their might, protect Islamic values, and liberate Turkestan from foreign influences.

The Madamin-Bey's forces have recently arrived in Tashkent, where the strikes paralyzed the life of city more and more and the tensions have drastically increased. As the Garrison's refused to disarm, the strikers call for decisive action against the Russians.

turkestan_railway_crisis.8.d: "The tension in New Tashkent had erupted into a full-blown crisis. The unyielding Russian Garrison, adamant in their refusal to disarm, found themselves in escalating confrontations with our government. The ominous presence of Madamin-Bey's loyal troops stationed nearby added to the volatility of the situation.\n\nThe incident unfolded on a scorching afternoon during a routine patrol by Russian soldiers. Intended as a display of strength, the patrol took an unexpected turn in a crowded market square. A verbal dispute escalated into physical clashes, turning the lively marketplace into a chaotic battleground. Local residents, aligned with Madamin-Bey's cause or the striking workers, rushed to confront the Russian soldiers. The situation quickly escalated from scuffles to armed clashes, with shots ringing out and chaos engulfing the streets of Tashkent.\n\nThe fierce and bloody confrontation persisted for hours, resulting in casualties on both sides and instilling fear and panic among the civilian population. Madamin-Bey's loyal troops, stationed just outside the city, received frantic reports of the violence. Swiftly moving in to protect their leader's interests, they intensified the fighting upon reinforcement. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the echoes of gunfire gradually faded, replaced by the wails of the wounded and the anguished cries of those who had lost loved ones. Tashkent had become a city scarred by violence and hatred, torn between loyalty to Russia and allegiance to Turkestan."

turkestan_railway_crisis.9.t: "Shokay's Dilemma"
turkestan_railway_crisis.9.d: "The violent clashes in Tashkent spread beyond Turkestan and attracted the attention of the Russian government. Reports of the fierce confrontation between the Russian garrison and the troops loyal to Madamin Bey quickly reached the corridors of power in Petrograd and caused a swift and unambiguous reaction.\n\nRussian diplomats, acting on behalf of the government, delivered a stern message to Mustafa Shokay's administration. The message contained both condemnation and a clear threat: the Turkestan incidents were seen as a direct challenge to Russian power in the region. Russia demanded immediate action to disarm Madamin Bey's troops and restore order, warning of the dire consequences of non-compliance.\n\nIn response, the Shokay government faced a critical situation. The choice was stark: seek a diplomatic solution by cooperating with the Russian garrison, attempting to contain Madamin Bey's actions to potentially ease tensions, but risking jeopardizing Turkestan's sovereignty. Either take a neutral stance, avoiding direct involvement and leaving the problem to Madamin Bey's troops, or seize the opportunity to defeat Madamin Bey's troops on their own while simultaneously challenging Russian colonial influence."
turkestan_railway_crisis.9.d2: "The violent clashes in Tashkent went unnoticed by the Russian government. Reports of the confrontation between the Russian Garrison and Madamin-Bey's loyal troops reached the highest echelons of power in Petrograd. However, there was no response from Russia...\n\nLeaving the Garrison to its fate, the Russians are likely to lose all of their control over Turkestan now. On the other hand, Shokay's government could now opt for a stance of neutrality, seeking to stay out of the conflict and leave Garrison's fate to Madamin-Bey's troops. On the other hand, this can be a perfect chance to independently crush Madamin-Bey's forces, supporting the Garrison - but using the chance to crush the Russian colonialists as well. The decision rested heavily on Shokay's shoulders, as he grappled with the complex web of alliances and rivalries that defined the political landscape of Turkestan. The future of the nation hung in the balance, and the consequences of this choice would shape the destiny of Turkestan for years to come."

turkestan_railway_crisis.12.t: "Diplomatic Failure"
turkestan_railway_crisis.12.d: "Mustafa Shokay attempted to resolve the conflict with the Russian Garrison diplomatically, but unfortunately, his efforts failed. The Russian authorities were not willing to accept the terms and instead threatened with immediate military intervention, leading to a rapid escalation of tensions in Tashkent, as the Russian Garrison faced a grim fate. Not only were they disarmed, but they were also subjected to a brutal and relentless assault. Reports of the massacre of the Russian Garrison reached the highest diplomatic echelons, sparking outrage and condemnation from foreign governments. The incident had brought Turkestan to the brink of a full-scale war with Russia, a situation the nation could not afford amidst its internal strife. However, the situation remained precarious because Madamin-Bey had taken control of the entire Central Asian Railway, a strategic asset that could tip the balance of power in his favour. As the crisis deepened and the world watched, Turkestan now stood on the brink of an uncertain and perilous future."
turkestan_railway_crisis.12.a: "It was dire to count on Russia."

turkestan_railway_crisis.13.t: "A Fragile Peace"
turkestan_railway_crisis.13.d: "Surprisingly, Russia accepted the conditions outlined by Mustafa Shokay and signed the so-called Tashkent Accords. The agreement, hailed by some as a step towards peace and stability, would have significant implications for the future of Turkestan.\n\nAccording to the accords, the Turkestan National Guard remained neutral but provided covert assistance to the Russian Garrison. This secret partnership, conducted behind the scenes, dealt a severe blow to Madamin-Bey's forces. As he began to lose ground, his once-loyal followers began to question his leadership. Faced with mounting pressure, Madamin-Bey was ultimately forced to abandon Tashkent. His flight from the city marked a significant decline in his popularity and influence, leaving a void that Shokay's government was quick to fill. As part of the treaty, the Russian Garrison cited solidarity with the "legitimate government of Turkestan" and prepared to withdraw from Turkestan, allowing Shokay's forces to take control of the previously contested New Tashkent. Although the populace celebrated this apparent display of Shokay's strength, the situation was far more complex. The Russian government's influence and pressure on Turkestan had increased significantly following the accords. Mustafa Shokay found himself in a precarious position, balancing Turkestan's internal and external dynamics as they continued to evolve."
turkestan_railway_crisis.13.a: "At least we have secured our positions."

turkestan_railway_crisis.14.t: "The Railway War"
turkestan_railway_crisis.14.d: "The situation in Turkestan took a dangerous turn when Mustafa Shokay refused to intervene in the escalating crisis. The government's inaction emboldened Madamin-Bey and, unchallenged, he launched a major operation to assert his dominance over New Tashkent. Under the cover of darkness, Madamin-Bey's forces, supported by his newfound alliance with the Turkestan Military Organisation, quickly seized control of Tashkent. Strikes that had halted the Central Asian Railway were violently suppressed, resulting in many striking workers and ERK supporters being arrested, injured or hidden. The ERK's leadership declared that they would continue their fight from the shadows.\n\nThe fate of the Russian Garrison was even more worrying. Left isolated and disarmed, they were at the mercy of Madamin-Bey's forces. A tense standoff occurred when Madamin-Bey's troops held the garrison hostage, preventing them from regaining control. The incident became known as the 'Railway War', and Shokay's government found itself in a difficult situation. The Russian government issued stern warnings, demanding immediate action to resolve the crisis and ensure the safety of the Russian Garrison. Shokay was faced with a difficult decision: cooperate with the Russian government to suppress Madamin-Bey's forces and regain control over New Tashkent, or risk further alienating Turkestan's populace and potentially losing sovereignty by doing so. Alternatively, Shokay could choose to leave the fate of the Russian Garrison in Madamin-Bey's hands. This approach would prevent direct confrontation with Russia, but it could also strengthen Madamin-Bey's position as a dominant force in Turkestan. The clock was ticking, and Shokay's decision would have significant consequences for the future of Turkestan."

turkestan_railway_crisis.15.d: "Mustafa Shokay's deliberations have come to an end. He saw the developing crisis as an opportunity to eliminate the threat posed by Madamin-Bey's Provisional Fergana Government, so he devised a daring plan. In a meticulously coordinated operation, Shokay's forces moved swiftly. Troops were dispatched to both the Fergana Valley and Tashkent, determined to crush the rival government and assert Shokay's authority. In Fergana, Madamin-Bey's government structures were fragile and ill-prepared for the rapid onslaught. They crumbled within days, allowing Shokay's forces to take control of the region.\n\nThe battle for Tashkent, however, was more challenging. Madamin-Bey's forces had entrenched themselves in the city, leading to a tense standoff. With the support of the Turkestan National Guard, Shokay's government launched a coordinated attack alongside the Russian Garrison, catching Madamin-Bey's forces off guard. Following several days of intense fighting, Madamin-Bey's forces were overwhelmed, and he was subsequently arrested and taken into custody. The Turkestan National Guard, led by Shokay loyalists, quickly secured the entire city. However, Shokay had one more surprise in store. Having taken control of Tashkent, Shokay ordered the Turkestan National Guard to disarm the Russian Garrison, which caught them off guard. This move took the Russian Garrison by surprise, leaving them powerless and enabling Shokay's forces to completely subdue the city. Shokay achieved a decisive victory with Madamin-Bey's government dismantled and the Russian Garrison disarmed. His rule now extended over much of the territory, and the immediate threat posed by his rivals had been eliminated, at least for now..."

turkestan_railway_crisis.16.d: "Mustafa Shokay's decision to jointly defeat Madamin-Bey and liberate the Russian Garrison had disastrous consequences. The plan, while ambitious, proved to be a catastrophic failure. Russia, grappling with its own challenges, could only offer Shokay formal \"approval\" for his endeavor, leaving him effectively alone against Madamin-Bey's formidable forces in Tashkent. Shokay's attempt to attack Madamin-Bey's \"bandit forces\" with the Turkestan National Guard resulted in a tragic outcome. The clash in the streets of Tashkent revealed that Shokay's forces were outmatched. Not only did they lose the battle, but they also witnessed a horrifying event. Madamin-Bey executed a significant number of the Russian Garrison, leaving only their command as hostages in an attempt to make a bold statement. This brutal action caused shockwaves throughout the region. With no alternative, the Turkestan National Guard was compelled to retreat, leaving Tashkent in the hands of Madamin-Bey's forces. The situation in Turkestan had become dire, with Madamin-Bey now calling for an open revolt against what he labeled the \"traitors of Turkestan\".\n\nReports of the government's shortcomings and Madamin-Bey's ascent to power rapidly spread, igniting uprisings and demonstrations in cities throughout Turkestan. The population, disenchanted with Shokay's leadership, began to support the charismatic figure of Madamin-Bey. In addition, the Russians, hearing of the latest developments, decided to withdraw all support for Shokay's government. They were left to fend for themselves. Turkestan now stood on the brink of a full-scale civil war, and its future was more uncertain than ever."

Instead, he pursued a path of prudence in an effort to prevent further bloodshed. Madamin-Bey's forces had executed most of the Russian Garrison command, sparing only the general staff as hostages. In response, Madamin-Bey declared Shokay's government illegitimate and called for open revolt against what he dubbed the \"traitors of Turkestan\". However, his actions were not universally supported. Many Turkestanis recognized that Shokay had tried to avoid being drawn into the conflict, aiming to prevent unnecessary violence. It was believed that Madamin-Bey chose to execute the Garrison of his own accord, without any external pressure.\n\nAt this crucial juncture, the ERK, who had also been affected by Madamin-Bey's actions, pledged their final allegiance to the Republic and the democratically elected government. They condemned Madamin-Bey's extremism and reiterated their dedication to resolving the crisis peacefully. The Ittifoqi Muslimin shared the same position, believing that democracy would be a more stable solution than civil war. The population, torn between two opposing factions, began to reconsider their allegiances. Although weakened, Shokay's government retained a semblance of legitimacy in the eyes of many Turkestanis who desired a peaceful and stable future for their homeland."

As the Turkestan Republic struggled with internal strife and external threats, Pishpek declared its independence and broke away from the central government. The decision was heavily influenced by [ALO.GetName], which had offered its guarantees to the unrecognized state. Despite protests from Shokay's government, which asserted that this was an internal matter, Pishpek's declaration of independence stood.

His forces encircled Samarqand, cutting off supply routes and communication lines and soon the city's defenders were forced to surrender, marking the final end of the Shokay government.\n\nHowever, both ERK and Mujahideen were now ready to strike the city, encircling Madamin-Bey in the same way he had defeated Shokay a few hours before. The advisers from the Peasant Army faction of our government suggested to the new leader of Turkestan a bold, lightning-fast assault, using speed and surprise as weapons. The conservative loyalists believed that the best approach to success was a diplomatic offer to Korşirmat. This would likely secure the alliance of our governments against the socialists in Tashkent."

United, they approached Tashkent, the industrial heartland and political bastion controlled by ERK. The echoes of diplomacy reverberated through the ancient walls of Samarqand.  The journey to Tashkent was uncertain. It could either solidify the fragile alliance or plunge Turkestan into further chaos. The forces gathered in the streets of Samarqand were a union of traditionalist fervor and pan-Islamist determination. The joint forces recognized the complexity of Tashkent's urban sprawl and ERK's entrenched positions, leading to a temporary stalemate. To consolidate their control, they can focus on Samarqand, Fergana Valley, and the Pamir Mountains instead of launching a frontal assault. Meanwhile, Madamin-Bey and the Mujahideen, fueled by their alliance's momentum, can attempt to advance towards Tashkent. Using their combined strength, they aim to aggressively assault ERK's stronghold. The joint forces will clash with ERK in the battle-hardened streets of Tashkent to dismantle their grip on power."

This will hardly help them, however. The provisional Fergana government finally came to power after decades of waiting and deception by the Jadidist tricksters.\n\nNow, however, there seem to be more problems. The alliance with the Mujahideen has already seriously affected the mood among the Fergana Peasant Army and their leader, Konstantin Monstrov, Madamin Bey's deputy. It seems that now the fragile peace has become even more fragile, and until Korşirmat and Monstrov are openly at each other's throats, it is Madamin-Bey who will be responsible for restoring a united Turkestan under his own rule."

The battle became chaotic and desperate as they fiercely assaulted the Turkestan Legion forces entrenched in the city. The ERK's defenses proved resilient and urban warfare favored the opposing forces. Despite early victories, Madamin-Bey's troops became trapped in a network of narrow streets. The planned coordination between Madamin-Bey and the Korshirmat Mujahideen fell apart in the face of fierce resistance from the ERK. Furthermore, the socialists saw an opportunity and launched a counteroffensive both in Tashkent and in Fergana valley.\n\nThe alliance between Madamin Bey and Korşirmat, which had promised to unite Turkestan, had dissolved. In the midst of the chaos, Korşirmat's forces in Tashkent faced betrayal from within. Elements sympathetic to the ERK turned against the Mujahideen, sowing discord and confusion in their ranks. Madamin Bey's troops retreated, battered and discouraged, as they faced defeat on all fronts. Realizing the futility of further resistance, Korşirmat retreated to the mountain refuge of the Eastern Pamirs. The ERK emerged victorious, now in control of Tashkent, Kokand, and most of Turkestan. However, the scars of the civil war remained, leaving behind a divided nation."

Despite initial gains, Madamin-Bey's forces faced heavy casualties, and Samarqand fell under ERK's dominance. While ERK battled against Madamin-Bey's assault, the Mujahideen launched an offensive to conquer the city of Fergana. The forces of Korşirmat have flooded into Fergana Valley, capturing key cities and tightening the noose around Kokand, Madamin-Bey's last stronghold. As the city's defenses crumbled, Madamin-Bey was taken captive. The execution of Madamin-Bey's confederates sealed the fate of his government, while the fate of Madamin-Bey himself was to be decided later.

With both ERK and Mujahideen eyeing the city, the Federal government now faced a choice. On one hand, we could prioritize the defense of Samarqand by fortifying its walls and gathering forces to repel any would-be conquerors. However, this would undoubtedly lead to a fierce battle as both groups sought to claim the city. The outcome of such a battle, however, is uncertain. On the other hand, we could acknowledge the vulnerability of the Fergana Valley and consolidate our recent conquest.

However, the bold plan was met with an unexpected amount of resistance. Anticipating Shokay's move, Madamin-Bey managed to muster a coherent defense. In Fergana, the clash of steel echoed through the streets as Shokay's forces encountered fierce resistance. Despite the element of surprise, the frontal assault was repelled, and the infiltrating units found themselves entangled in a maze of fortified positions.As a result, Fergana remained under the control of Madamin-Bey, dealing a significant blow to Shokay's aspirations. Although exhausted by Shokay's attack, Madamin-Bey was forced to dissolve his government due to the threat of another attack, this time from Korşirmat in the south. Madamin-Bey and his loyalists have agreed to join the ranks of the Islamic Revolutionary Society, now against both ERK and the Mujahideen. Meanwhile, as Shokay grappled with the failure in Fergana, Samarqand was left vulnerable to the converging forces of ERK and the Mujahideen. Both factions recognized the strategic importance of the city and directed their forces towards its ancient walls.  Shokay faced a critical decision: should he gather more forces in Kokand to prepare for an offensive strike on Tashkent or Osh while ERK and Mujahideen contested Samarqand, exposing their rears?

Isolated and facing numerous challenges, the once-dominant Bolshevik methods proved ineffective in maintaining control over Turkestan. The failure of Soviet Russia to provide much-needed support left the region vulnerable, and those opposing the regime began to seize the opportunity to strengthen their forces.\n\nDuring the Askhabad Mutiny, a Trans-Caspian Provisional Government emerged, backed by the British mission, further weakening the grip of the Bolsheviks. This newfound opposition found allies in various quarters. In November 1918, the Fergana Peasant Army, led by Monstrov and comprising volunteer units of peasant settlers, rallied against the Bolsheviks in Jalal-Abad. In Tashkent, in January 1919, a rebellion orchestrated by the military commissar Osipov resulted in the loss of many lives of Soviet workers.\n\nAs the year progressed, opposition forces united against the Bolsheviks. The Peasant Army, Madamin Bey Mojahedin, and the Semirechye Army Cossacks joined hands, culminating in the formation of the Provisional Fergana Government. The relentless resistance led to the eventual overthrow of Bolshevik power in Turkestan. The Provisional Fergana Government, in a moment of historic significance, declared the restoration of the Turkestan Republic and the end of the oppressive dictatorships that once held sway over the region."

The restoration of the Minister-President's office saw a liberal reformer Mustafa Shokay taking the helm, accompanied by the establishment of a parliamentary body known as the Khalq Majlisi and the formation of a new government. Despite these efforts, Russia's control over Turkestan proved untenable, leading to the eventual withdrawal of Russian troops from most of the region, except for the Tashkent Garrison..\n\nUnder Mustafa Shokay's leadership as Minister-President, the Republic of Turkestan attempted to navigate the complexities of a country grappling with internal problems. Despite its liberal-leaning regime in comparison to its neighbor, the Emirate of Bukhara, the Turkestan Federative Republic faced mounting challenges that threatened its stability.\n\nFor the past 16 years, Shokay has struggled to hold together a nation on the verge of disintegration. A fragile coalition government between the Jadidists and Qadimists has been fraught with internal dissent, and in the East Pamir, a Mujahedeen uprising has erupted, adding to the nation's woes. On another front, the Pan-Turkist socialist movement 'ERK' is gaining popularity, further complicating the political landscape."

turkestan.204.t: "Rival Governments of Turkestan"
turkestan.204.d: "Although to the outside eye it would appear that power in Turkestan belongs to the legitimate government of Mustafa Shokay, the reality is more complex. Indeed, the government, based in the ancient city of Kokand, is a symbol of balance and compromise. Now Mustafa Shokay's government is a coalition, an intricate dance between Jadidist reformists and Qadimist traditionalists. It is a fragile alliance born out of necessity amid the chaotic turmoil of the Turkestan Republic. Mustafa Shokay, a pragmatic and experienced diplomat, believes that only by bridging the split between Jadidists and Qadimists can Turkestan find stability. He envisions a republic that adheres to democratic values and respects the rights of its diverse population. Shokay's main goal is to prevent Turkestan from disintegrating.\n\nAlthough the government formally controls most of Turkestan, there are areas beyond its reach. Less than a hundred kilometers from Kokand lies the city of Fergana, the heart of the Fergana Valley. Power in the city and the entire valley since the civil war belongs to the Provisional Fergana Government, the true winners of the war, who achieved Turkestan's independence with arms in their hands, not for the Russians to \"put Shokay in charge\". Madamin-Bey reigns supreme in the valley - his vision is in stark contrast to Shokay's pragmatic coalition. A pragmatic but authoritarian leader, he believes Turkestan needs a firm hand to restore order and assert its independence. Madamin-Bey's main goal is to consolidate power over the entire region, free itself from outside influence and unite Turkestan under centralized authority. In his view, this was the only way to achieve stability and end the chaos that had engulfed the country.\n\nIn the rugged terrain of the East Pamir, Korşirmat and his Mujahideen adhere to their own vision for the future of Turkestan. Their vision is rooted in Islamic principles and calls for adherence to Sharia law as they consider themselves the guardians of the faith. Korşirmat's goal is clear: to create an Emirate of Turkestan where Islamic laws and principles will prevail. He believes in the power of religion to unite the various peoples of the region under a common banner of faith.\n\nHowever, this is not a far cry from the power struggles throughout Turkestan. In the bustling streets of Tashkent and other industrial centers, the population prefers to see the socialists of the ERK in power, while the Russian peasants who came to Turkestan under Stolypin's program support Konstantin Monstrov's Peasant Army. In addition, the clandestine Turkestan Military Organization, which dreams of bringing \"Russian civilization\" back to this \"frontier lands\", also claims power."
turkestan.204.a: "A real hotbed for chaos!"

turkestan.203.t: "Turkestan Military Organisation"
turkestan.203.d: "In February 1918, the Turkestan Military Organization (TVO) emerged as a clandestine anti-Bolshevik group, founded by former officers of the Tsarist army, Russian intellectuals, and former officials. Nicknamed the White Guard of Turkestan, the TVO played a significant role in defeating the Bolsheviks during the Turkestan Civil War. The organization received active assistance from foreign intelligence agents, primarily the British, with figures like Wilfred Malleson and agents operating under the guise of foreign diplomatic missions accredited in Tashkent under the Soviet government.\n\nMembers of this underground organization established connections with Ataman Dutov, General Denikin, Alash Orda Kazakhs, the Emir of Bukhara, leaders of Fergana and Turkmen Mujahideen, Transcaspian White Guard forces, and English consuls in Kashgar, Kulja, and Meshed. Konstantin Osipov, a former Bolshevik who staged a rebellion against his own in January 1919, the peasant army of Konstantin Monstrov, and the Madamin-Bey's Mujahideen - all became mere pawns in the cunning game of the Turkestan Military Organization.\n\nThe leader of the organization, Pyotr Kornilov, brother of the Russian military commander Lavr Kornilov, though perished, leaving a power vacuum within the organization. In this void, Osipov and Monstrov, former ideological opponents, joined forces for a common goal, gaining the upper hand. Meanwhile, Madamin-Bey also played a crucial role in the organization, but it is clear that this triumvirate will not willingly share power if they manage to seize it - and they most certainly will try..."

turkestan.205.t: "The Turkestan Derby"
turkestan.205.d: "In the heart of Turkestan, where the echoes of political rivalry reverberated through every corner, there existed a different kind of contest — one that cut through the deep divide in the country. Football, often hailed as the \"beautiful game\", had taken on a deeper significance in the region.\n\nThis crisp, sun-kissed afternoon, the streets of Kokand and Fergana buzzed with anticipation. The two cities are not just geographical neighbors; they are also rival capitals of opposing political ideologies. Kokand is the seat of power for Mustafa Shokay's government. Fergana, on the other hand, is the stronghold of Madamin-Bey's Provisional Fergana Government. As the Turkestan Derby loomed, tension hangs in the air. This isn't merely a football match; it is a microcosm of the larger struggle for Turkestan's soul. The Kokand team is a symbol of the coalition, while the Fergana team embodies the uncompromising spirit of Madamin-Bey's government.\n\nFans painted in their team's colors flooded the streets, their cheers and chants echoing through the urban canyons. Families and friendships are divided along political lines, creating a palpable tension that only deepened the stakes. The referee's whistle has pierced the air, and the match begins. On the pitch, 22 athletes battle for supremacy, but the real contest unfolded in the hearts and minds of the spectators. Every pass, every tackle, every goal was imbued with meaning far beyond sport. It is a testament to the resilience of a people determined to find unity in diversity or uphold the uncompromising pursuit of a singular vision.\n\nAs the final whistle blows, one team emerges victorious, but the scoreline did little to sway the convictions of those who watched. In the wake of the Turkestan Derby, the divide remains as deep as ever, but for a brief moment, the power of sport had brought people together, if only to remind them of the complex tapestry of their shared identity in a land where football reflected more than just a game — it mirrored the struggle for Turkestan's future."

turkestan.206.t: "Tensions in East Pamir"
turkestan.206.d: "In the secluded region of East Pamir, nestled amidst the rugged mountains and pristine valleys, life carried on at its own pace. Isolated from the political machinations of the Turkestan Republic to the west, this remote part of the nation had always maintained an air of autonomy. East Pamir consisted of scattered settlements, the most prominent among them being the town of Murghab, a bastion of local governance. The people here were known for their self-reliance, with each community adhering to its own customs and traditions. Among them, Korşirmat, a charismatic and fiery leader, had emerged as a figure of influence. \n\nRecently, rumors had begun to circulate through the region like a gust of desert wind. Whispers spoke of the emergence of an enigmatic group — the Islamic Revolutionary Society. Some claimed it was a clandestine organization formed to champion the cause of pan-Islamism, while others insisted it was a manifestation of discontent with the Turkestan Republic's secular policies. As the winds of change rustled through the valleys of East Pamir, a sense of unease settled over the land. Korşirmat, the charismatic leader, was believed to be associated with this mysterious society. The Emirate of Bukhara, a neighboring power, watched these developments with interest, its own expansionist ambitions casting a shadow over the region. Though tensions in East Pamir remained localized for now, there were murmurs that this remote corner of Turkestan might become the spark that ignited a larger conflict, with the Islamic Revolutionary Society at the center of it all. The delicate balance in this isolated land seemed poised on the edge of transformation, and the ripples of change threatened to reach far beyond the rugged peaks of East Pamir."

turkestan.207.t: "The Birth of the National Guard"
turkestan.207.d: "In Turkestan, some may claim that power was always fragmented and regional allegiances held sway, and therefore the notion of a centralized and state-controlled armed force had long remained elusive. Local militias, often doubling as law enforcement, known as Mirshabs, maintained an uneasy peace throughout the land. These units, led by various figures of influence, including Ergash Bey, had historically pledged their loyalties to different factions within the republic, creating an intricate web of allegiances.\n\nErgash-Bey, himself a staunch advocate of Qadimist principles, commanded a considerable following within the Mirshab units. His association with the Ittifoqi Muslimin further fueled doubts about the militias' loyalty to the Turkestan Republic as a whole.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, other armed groups had emerged. The Turkestan Legion, a paramilitary wing of the ERK party, operated with a vision of radical change and socialist transformation. Korşirmat's Mujahideen, embodying pan-Islamist ideals, stood as formidable contenders, particularly in the eastern reaches of the nation. Loyal forces rallied under the banner of Madamin-Bey, with the Fergana Peasant Army of Russian settlers adding a unique dimension to the shifting power dynamics. Amidst this complex landscape, Mustafa Shokay, the leader of the Turkestan Republic, recognized the need for a force that could provide stability and loyalty to his government. In a bold move, he issued a decree of the establishment of the Turkestan National Guard — an armed force dedicated to defending the interests of the republic and ensuring its sovereignty.\n\nWith the birth of the National Guard, Shokay aims to forge a military entity that transcends regional affiliations. He seeks to create a cohesive and disciplined force that would operate in the service of the entire nation, rather than factional interests. The move not only marked a significant step toward military development within Turkestan but also signaled Shokay's determination to consolidate his rule and assert the authority of the central government. As the fledgling Turkestan National Guard take its first steps, it is remained to be seen how this new force would navigate the intricate web of rivalries and allegiances that had defined the Turkestan Republic thus far."

turkestan.208.t: "The Railroad and Tashkent Condominium"
turkestan.208.d: "The construction of railroads in Central Asia was a turning point in the history of Turkestan, establishing powerful links between the interior of Russia and the vast lands of Turkestan. These railroads breathed life into the agricultural sector, spurred the textile industry, and helped integrate the region into the all-Russian market. The Central Asian railroad system became the lifeblood of trade and commerce, but the railroad's role went far beyond economic importance: it became a decisive player in the Turkestan civil war. During the conflict, control of these vital railroad arteries became a matter of strategic importance. The railroad's control points often determined the movement of troops and goods, making it a valuable asset in the midst of unrest.\n\nAfter the cessation of hostilities, a treaty was signed between Russia and the Turkestan Republic, officially recognizing the latter's independence. However, the city of Tashkent, the most important junction of the Central Asian railroad, posed a special problem because of its large Russian-speaking population. To resolve this sensitive issue, authority over the two main parts of Tashkent was officially divided. The majority Muslim neighborhoods of Old Tashkent were administered by the Turkestan Republic, while New Tashkent, which had a predominantly Russian population, was administered by a Russian garrison stationed within its boundaries. In effect, the neighborhood functioned as an extension of the Russian government. Outside the city limits of Tashkent, the broad Tashkent region became a diplomatic condominium. Within this territory, representatives of the Turkestan Republic and the Russian garrison cooperated, and sometimes clashed, in the administration of the region's affairs. It was a complex arrangement aimed at maintaining some semblance of stability in postwar Turkestan.\n\nBut perhaps the most important result of these agreements was control of the Central Asian railroad. This intricate network of tracks and terminals came under the jurisdiction of the Russian government, with a Russian garrison based in Tashkent overseeing compliance with the treaty. This control allowed the garrison to tightly control trade and logistics, effectively influencing the economic and political landscape of the entire region. In addition, the Russophile Turkestan Military Organization was given a stronghold in New Tashkent, further complicating the situation. For the various internal factions vying for influence in Turkestan, control of the railroads remained a powerful symbol of true independence. Many believed that only when Turkestan regained control of vital transportation arteries would the dream of full independence become a reality. The struggle for dominance over the Central Asian Railroad would determine the fate of the Turkestan Republic and the extent of its sovereignty in the years to come."
turkestan.208.a: "We should achieve our sovereignity."

turkestan.209.t: "Turmoil in the Markets"
turkestan.209.d: "Turkestan had long stood as a vibrant economic crossroads, with our prosperity deeply intertwined with the Silk Road. Trade routes stretching across the vast expanse of Central Asia converged within our borders, and our merchants bartered goods with far-reaching lands. For years, this economic tapestry had woven together the fortunes of the Turkestan Republic with those of its neighbors. However, the stability of the Russian ruble, upon which Turkestan's economic health hinged, began to falter. An unsettling wave of uncertainty rippled through Russia's economic foundations, resulting in the devaluation of the ruble. With each fall in its value, the tremors of this economic upheaval reverberated through Turkestan's markets.\n\nThe once-steady value of the ruble was now eroding rapidly. Prices soared higher each day as merchants and traders struggled to keep up with the skyrocketing cost of imports. Goods that had once been readily available became luxuries few could afford. As economic uncertainty gripped the land, businesses shuttered their doors. Once bustling marketplaces now stood desolate, their owners unable to bear the weight of financial ruin. Moreover, mass unemployment plagued the republic as companies faced insurmountable losses. Turkestan's citizens, once gainfully employed, found themselves cast adrift in a sea of uncertainty. The ordinary rhythms of life were disrupted as families struggled to make ends meet. The cost of living skyrocketed, and long lines formed outside stores that still had wares to sell. The government is caught in a tumultuous storm, faced with a nation in economic turmoil."

turkestan.210.t: "Navigating the Crisis"
turkestan.210.d: "The economic turmoil sweeping across Turkestan has cast a dark shadow over the republic, challenging our leaders to make difficult decisions. Mustafa Shokay's government now faces a crucial juncture, as they must choose a course of action to address the ongoing economic crisis. The choices before them carry distinct consequences.\n\nIn a bid to stabilize the economy, the government can implement stringent austerity measures. These measures include cutting public spending, reducing subsidies, and implementing higher taxes. While this approach may lead to short-term hardships for citizens, it is seen as a prudent way to restore fiscal responsibility and encourage foreign investment. However, it may also spark protests and civil unrest due to the harsh economic conditions imposed on the population. Alternatively, the government can choose to provide direct economic relief to its citizens, focusing on safeguarding their well-being during these turbulent times. By offering subsidies, food aid, and temporary financial assistance, they aim to alleviate the immediate suffering of the population. While this approach may gain support from the people and quell social unrest, it could strain the government's resources and lead to long-term economic challenges. The government can opt for a more ambitious approach by encouraging self-reliance and diversification of trade. By investing in local industries, promoting agricultural self-sufficiency, and seeking alternative trade partners beyond Russia and [KHI.GetName], Turkestan can work towards long-term economic resilience. This choice may take time to yield results, but it aims to reduce the republic's dependence on the Russian economy."

turkestan.211.t: "Turmoil in Tashkent and Samarqand"
turkestan.211.d: "In the heart of Turkestan, the ancient cities of Tashkent and Samarqand, found themselves at the center of a different kind of history — the history of protest, dissent, and social unrest. The economic downturn and austerity measures imposed by the government had pushed the citizens to their limits, and the streets bore witness to their collective frustration. The bustling streets of Tashkent, the capital of Turkestan, had transformed into a tableau of dissent. A diverse sea of citizens, representing all walks of life, converged in the city center. It was a vibrant mosaic of voices—students, laborers, merchants, intellectuals, and families—all united by a common message: they had endured enough. The air was electric with fervor, and a chorus of chants filled the streets. Placards bearing messages of defiance reached toward the sky, their messages echoing the collective anger that had ignited this unprecedented protest. \"Bread and jobs, not austerity!\" they cried, and their voices reverberated against the concrete jungle.\n\nIn Samarqand, the city known for its magnificent architecture and historical significance, the unrest was equally palpable. The iconic Registan Square, typically a hub of tourism and cultural appreciation, had become the stage for dissent. Beneath the majestic arches of the ancient madrasas, the protesters gathered. The Registan, bathed in the golden glow of the setting sun, was now the backdrop for a different kind of history. Placards bearing messages of defiance were held high against the backdrop of centuries-old architecture, a powerful symbol of the intersection between tradition and modernity.\n\nTurkestan was at a crossroads, and the government faced a difficult choice — where to deploy its forces to suppress the unrest, in Tashkent or Samarqand, as the resources of the yet small National Guard are limited. The decision would carry profound consequences for the nation's future."
turkestan.211.a: "Focus on Tashkent riots."

turkestan.212.t: "A Nation on the Brink"
turkestan.212.d.intro: "Turkestan's largest city, Tashkent, stood at the epicenter of a growing storm. Protests had erupted in the city, swelling into a mass of discontented voices demanding change. It was a precarious situation that left Mustafa Shokay with a grave decision to make —should he suppress the unrest in Tashkent or in Samarqand?
turkestan.212.d: "$turkestan.212.d.intro$\n\nPresident Shokay weighed the implications carefully. Tashkent was a complex web of influences; it housed the Russian Garrison, a simmering hub of Russophile sentiment, making it a potential powder keg. The ERK party had a strong presence here, and whispers suggested that the Turkestan Military Organisation had covert operations in the city as well. Suppressing dissent in Tashkent could potentially quell these hotbeds of opposition. The government's decision was clear: they would focus their efforts on suppressing the turmoil in Tashkent. Mirshabs and National Guard units were mobilized with precision. The streets of the capital bore witness to clashes between the authorities and those demanding change. Days turned into nights, and nights into days, as the government maintained its grip on Tashkent. The once-vibrant city had been transformed into a battleground, its citizens divided and its spirit scarred."
turkestan.212.d2: "$turkestan.212.d.intro$\n\nPresident Shokay considered the implications of his decision. Samarqand, a city deeply rooted in Jadidist culture, had limited influence from external factions. Its people, for the most part, were supportive of Shokay's party. Suppressing the unrest here would maintain a stronghold in the heartland of Turkestan and send a strong message that the government stood by its supporters. With a heavy heart, Shokay chose to suppress the turmoil in Samarqand. Mirshabs and National Guard units were deployed swiftly, their presence felt throughout the city. Protesters were met with force, as the authorities sought to restore calm. Samarqand, once a city steeped in history and culture, became an arena of clashes between those demanding change and those determined to maintain the status quo. Tear gas and batons were employed to disperse the crowds, leaving the streets filled with tension."
turkestan.212.a: "The choice was made."

turkestan.213.t: "The Weight of Sacrifices"
turkestan.213.d: "The sun dipped below the horizon in Turkestan, casting long shadows over the bustling streets of Tashkent. In these trying times, President Shokay was faced with a daunting decision, one that carried the burden of immediate sacrifices for the sake of long-term economic resilience. As the government tightened its belt, the people of Turkestan felt the pinch of austerity. While President Shokay spoke of future prosperity, the present bore the weight of job losses and economic uncertainty. Factories, once humming with activity, now stood silent. The surge of unemployment was palpable as workers who once toiled tirelessly found themselves without jobs to support their families. In the teahouses and bazaars, conversations were filled with stories of neighbors and friends joining the ranks of the unemployed. The lines at job centers grew longer, and uncertainty about the future loomed large in the minds of Turkestan citizens.\n\nTrade disruptions, another consequence of the government's measures, added to the daily struggles. Turkestan's markets were in flux as imported goods became scarcer, and prices soared. Shelves that once held a variety of foreign products now displayed empty spaces. Families felt the impact as the cost of imported goods, from clothing to everyday necessities, became increasingly unaffordable. The once-familiar products from foreign lands were now out of reach for many. Business owners and traders, too, grappled with the changes. Trade routes that had long sustained Turkestan's commerce were suddenly severed or altered, forcing them to adapt to new realities."

turkestan.214.d: "The sun dipped below the horizon in Turkestan, casting long shadows over the bustling streets of Tashkent. In these trying times, President Shokay made a solemn promise to his people. In the face of economic turmoil and growing unrest, his government had chosen to prioritize the well-being of its citizens. With unwavering determination, Shokay's government rolled out a comprehensive program aimed at offering immediate relief to the population. The government implemented subsidies to lower the cost of essential goods, ensuring that even the most vulnerable citizens could afford daily necessities. Markets that had been barren now saw goods returning to their shelves. Food distribution centers sprung up across major cities, offering provisions to those in need. Families struggling to put meals on their tables found solace in these lifelines of sustenance. Unemployment benefits and financial aid packages were swiftly introduced to support those who had lost their jobs. These measures provided a semblance of security in times of uncertainty. The effect of these relief measures was immediately apparent. Families, burdened by the fear of hunger and financial ruin, began to breathe a sigh of relief. Turkestan's markets buzzed with activity once more, as shopkeepers restocked their stalls and merchants resumed their trade. Yet, the road ahead was not without its challenges. The strain on government resources was undeniable. Subsidies and aid packages came at a significant cost, putting pressure on an already fragile economy. The question of how to sustain these relief efforts in the long term now weigh heavily on Shokay's administration."

As a ruler of a region endowed with fertile lands and agricultural wealth, he knew that his choices could reshape the economic landscape. The crisis was reaching a tipping point, and he was faced with a critical decision. Madamin-Bey considered doubling down on Fergana's self-sufficiency measures: the fertile fields of Fergana had always been a source of pride for its people. Embracing local autonomy meant reinforcing these values and further distancing the region from Turkestan's troubles. Alternatively, Madamin-Bey could choose to seek cooperation with other Turkestan factions and the Shokay government."

turkestan.216.t: "Dissent Among the Fergana Government"
turkestan.216.d: "Fergana Valley, with its lush fields and diverse population, had long been a place of coexistence and tension. At the heart of these complexities lay the Russian peasant settlers who had carved their lives into this fertile land, while the local population, steeped in their own traditions, watched warily. For years, these two communities had managed an uneasy coexistence, each harboring their own dreams of autonomy and control over their destiny. The Fergana Peasant Army, led by Konstantin Monstrov and aligned with Madamin-Bey's government, had once fought alongside them, seeking to protect the Russian settlers from Mujahideen threats.\n\nHowever, Madamin-Bey's latest decision to embrace collaborative economic reforms had sown the seeds of discontent among the settlers. As rumors spread like wildfire through the valley, concerns deepened, and whispers of resistance became louder. Konstantin Monstrov, a man who had once been Madamin-Bey's staunch ally, found himself caught in a storm of uncertainty. He had rallied the settlers, promising to safeguard their way of life, their farms, and their autonomy. But now, the promise of reform threatened the very foundation of the Russian settlers' existence.\n\n\"Your Excellency,\" Monstrov began, addressing Madamin-Bey in a tense meeting, \"we've fought together, bled together, but now the settlers fear that our struggle has been in vain. They see these reforms as an encroachment on their way of life. Our relationship with the locals has always been delicate, and this move may lead to open conflict. We must tread carefully.\"\n\nMadamin-Bey, once the hero of Fergana, now faced resistance from those who had stood at his side. As the settlers' grievances grew, so did the rift between them and the local population. Tensions simmered beneath the surface, threatening to boil over into a conflict that could tear Fergana Valley apart. The once-united front was cracking, and Madamin-Bey's government found itself grappling with the weight of uncertainty. The road to collaborative reforms, it seemed, was fraught with peril, and the unity of Turkestan was hanging in the balance."

turkestan.217.t: "Threat of Divided Economies"
turkestan.217.d: "The leadership of Turkestan stood at a crossroads, gazing at a dilemma that had been brewing beneath the surface for far too long. In the heart of this multifaceted nation, Fergana had emerged as both a vital contributor to Turkestan's prosperity and a potential challenge to its unity. Mustafa Shokay, at the helm of Turkestan's government, recognizes the undeniable truth: Fergana is an integral part of the republic's economic fabric. Its fertile fields, rich agricultural output, and bustling trade has long contributed to the nation's well-being. Yet, recent developments in Madamin-Bey's fiefdom posed a troubling question - could Fergana's newfound self-sufficiency threaten Turkestan's stability?\n\nShokay addressed the issue directly, gathered alongside his advisors, and presented his perspective. \"Fergana is not just any region within our diverse republic. For years, our nation has thrived on the products, trade, and resources that flow from this region. Its success has been our success, and we have celebrated it as such. But now, Madamin-Bey's efforts to make Fergana self-sufficient are undeniably affecting our republic's economic balance.\"\n\nAs Fergana continued to assert its economic autonomy, Shokay's government faced a critical decision on how to respond to this growing challenge. Fergana's self-sufficiency threatened to undermine the unity of Turkestan, and Shokay's government sought ways to assert its influence. One option was to impose an economic blockade on Fergana by controlling and blocking the critical railroads connecting the region to the rest of Turkestan. This would disrupt the flow of goods in and out of Fergana, putting pressure on its economy. While this might weaken Fergana's government economically, it could also lead to resentment and potentially radicalize the population. This choice reflects Shokay's determination to maintain control over the entire country, even at the cost of economic hardships. On the other hand, Shokay's government could choose to invest heavily in the development of other regions within Turkestan, with the aim of reducing dependence on Fergana's resources. By fostering economic growth and self-sufficiency elsewhere, they could decrease Fergana's leverage over the republic. However, this approach would take time to yield results and required substantial financial investments. This option represents Shokay's commitment to preserving the unity of Turkestan by strengthening regions outside of Fergana."

Its mines had fueled the fires of progress, contributing significantly to the nation's energy needs and economic prosperity. However, in recent days, the dark tunnels beneath Sülüktü had become the stage for a different kind of drama, one that threatened to plunge the region into turmoil. The coal miners of Sülüktü had risen in protest. Fueled by grievances over working conditions, wages, and safety concerns, their strike had paralyzed the coal production, sending shockwaves through the region's power plants and industries. Mustafa Shokay, the leader of Turkestan, faced a formidable challenge. The nation's energy supply hung in the balance, and the striking miners demanded a response.\n\nThere are two choices for the government how it should address the strikes. On the one hand, we can negotiate with the miners, but on the other hand we can opt for a heavy-handed approach."

For the workers, it was a day to celebrate their labor, their contributions to society, and their unity. But this year, the celebrations carried an undercurrent of tension that threatened to disrupt the harmony of the day. The streets of Tashkent were festooned with banners and flags, and the city's workers and residents turned out in force. ERK, the opposition political party, had organized a massive May Day demonstration, calling for workers' rights, better living conditions, and an end to what they saw as the government's oppressive policies. As the sun climbed higher in the sky, a sea of protesters flooded the central square. The atmosphere was filled with chants, songs, and passionate speeches that resonated with the crowd. Men and women, young and old, raised their voices in unison, demanding change. The government, led by Mustafa Shokay, faced a difficult decision. While they acknowledged the people's right to peaceful assembly, the sheer scale of the protest and the fiery rhetoric of the ERK leaders raised alarms. Shokay gathered his advisors to discuss the situation.\n\nShokay can choose to respect the people's right to assemble and express their grievances. Allowing the peaceful demonstration to continue without interference may help in voicing the demonstrators' grievances and maintaining democratic values. However, it could also allow ERK to mobilize and gain further support.\n\nAlternatively, Shokay can choose to disperse the protesters, fearing that the demonstration could escalate into violence or turn into a show of defiance against his government. Ordering the police to intervene, using tear gas and batons to break up the gathering, may disrupt the protest but also risk increasing opposition to Shokay's government."

turkestan.220.d: "The East Turkestan civil war had sent shockwaves across the region, but our Republic found itself at the heart of an unfolding humanitarian crisis. In the border regions, particularly in East Pamir and Pishpek, the turmoil in Kashgar had triggered a mass exodus of refugees, most of whom were of Kyrgyz origin. As the news of this crisis reached the capital, a sense of urgency permeated the highest echelons of government. Reports from the border towns spoke of desperate families, their lives upended by violence and uncertainty, crossing into Turkestan seeking refuge. The dusty roads leading from Kashgar and Dihua to Turkestan's border regions were now crowded with people, young and old, clutching what little belongings they could carry.\n\nOpening the borders and offering humanitarian aid seemed the most compassionate choice, one that Turkestan could be proud of. Refugees would find safety, shelter, and relief in Turkestan, despite a great pressure on our budget. Some members of the Cabinet argued for caution. Under this approach, Turkestan would limit access at the border, subject refugees to stringent security checks, and direct them to established refugee camps. While this would reduce the strain on urban resources, it risked lacking of resources of the National Guard to control the situation. Finally, there were voices in the government calling for a stricter response. Turkestan would secure its borders, preventing refugees from entering. This would prioritize national security and stability, but would greatly demonize the government in the eyes of our citizens. The cost to pay for this decision can be too high."

As the conflict in East Turkestan escalated, so did the demand for illicit goods on the black market. Our country, situated at the crossroads of Central Asia, found itself in the middle of this shadowy trade. The black market, always a persistent presence in the region, experienced unprecedented growth during the East Turkestan crisis. Smugglers, opportunists, and criminal networks capitalized on the chaos, flooding the market with contraband. Everything from weapons and drugs to stolen goods and counterfeit currency found its way onto the illicit market. President Shokay's government could not ignore the surge in black market activity. His administration had always been committed to maintaining law and order. They argued that clamping down on the black market was essential to curb criminal activity, preserve Turkestan's security, and protect the well-being of its citizens. Some voices in the government proposed a more pragmatic approach. They argued that with our struggling economy, it would be wise to regulate and tax the black market. Another proposal emphasized the practical benefits of the black market, as the revenue generated from the black market can be used to fund the National Guard"

Despite the shift towards a democratic era, the Turkestan Rouble persisted as the primary currency in the aftermath of the conflict, supplemented by a prevalence of barter transactions. Foreign trade relied on Russian roubles, exposing Turkestan to the economic fluctuations of its neighbor. The subsequent crash of the Russian market triggered inflation, sparking an urgent need for Turkestan to establish its own national currency. In response to the economic crisis, the government of Turkestan embarked on a significant financial reform – the establishment of the Central Bank of Turkestan. This marked a crucial step toward economic autonomy and stability.\n\nThe decision was made – the Turkestan Tenga would be the cornerstone of this financial metamorphosis. The air buzzed with anticipation as the populace awaited a currency that would truly belong to them. At a rate of 1 Rouble to 10 Tenga, the Tenga was set to reclaim the narrative of Turkestan's economic destiny. As the Tenga made its debut, currency exchange programs unfolded across the land. Banks became hubs of transformation, exchanging the old Roubles for the new Tenga. The people, now armed with a currency uniquely theirs, embarked on a journey of economic rejuvenation. Beyond the tangible currency, the newly established Central Bank of Turkestan assumed a pivotal role in sculpting the nation's monetary policy. As the custodian of economic stability, it undertook the responsibility of regulating the money supply, interest rates, and currency issuance. Ensuring the health of the financial sector was paramount. The Central Bank, as the nation's financial custodian, implemented rigorous regulatory and supervisory frameworks to fortify banks and financial institutions against risks."

turkestan.223.t: "Offer From the Russo-Asiatic Bank`"
turkestan.223.d: "In the midst of the economic crisis, a fateful letter arrived from the Russian-Asian Bank - a beacon of hope and danger. The bank unexpectedly agreed to a loan. The offer, like a shimmering mirage, offered a chance for financial salvation. A loan, solid, but at high interest, lay before our government like a double-edged sword. The promise of immediate relief beckoned, but at the same time the shadow of potential long-term bondage loomed. The choice, though seemingly simple, was fraught with serious consequences. Turkestan stood at a crossroads, caught between the urgent need to revitalize the economy and a dangerous dependence on an unstable neighbor. The Russian-Asian Bank, which was characterized by dubious generosity, offered an agreement that could either provide a temporary reprieve or plunge the country into further vulnerability. After all, we can always reject another generous offer from the Russians..."

turkestan.224.t: "The Merchant, The Moon, The Settled Uzbek"
turkestan.224.d: "\"The Obscure Word 'Sart'\" is an article published by Mahmudkhodja Behbudiy in 1915. It could put an end to the issue of this term, which Imperial Russia used to call settled Uzbeks. The term has a complex history, having been both a symbol of occupational definition, a linguistic enigma, and even a pejorative marker. The term has a long history, originating from Sanskrit, where it meant 'merchant.'  Over time, the Turkic-speaking population in Ferghana, Tashkent, and beyond was influenced by Mongolian and Arabic, and after that the language became a tool of Russian imperial policy. During the Imperial Russia era, the term 'Sart' was used to refer broadly to the settled population.\n\nHowever, under the new government, which sought pan-Turkism and social cohesion, the term came under scrutiny. Although it had previously been used as a tool of colonial policy, its origin and meaning were now a real mystery. The Shokai government acknowledged the necessity of a new linguistic framework to attain social cohesion. Laws were enacted to relegate the term 'Sart' to the annals of history, as it had become a vestige of a past era and a representation of oppressive Russian colonialism. Jadidist intellectuals were elated when the word 'Sart' vanished from official discourse. Citizens also contributed to shaping this narrative. The saying, 'A bad Kyrgyz becomes a Sart and a bad Sart becomes a Kyrgyz,' has been around for many years, but it will finally fade into oblivion. People, in general, rejoiced at the disappearance of this pejorative term. Thus, Turkestan left behind the quirks and follies of imperial politics that once tried to define the indefinable."

turkestan.225.t: "Rebirth of Tashkent Military School"
turkestan.225.d: "In 1914, on the eve of Weltkrieg, the Tashkent Military School unfurled its banner under the auspices of Imperial Russia. Beyond its gates, there also existed a sibling - the \"Tashkent School for Training of Infantry Warrant Officers\", established in 1915. Warrant officers would march forth to serve the Turkestan Military District. With the rise of Soviet authority in 1917, the school met its untimely demise. The school became a theater of conflict, as junkers clashed with Bolshevik forces during the Bolshevik Uprising in Tashkent. Despite the upheavals, the school lingered on for a brief period until the spring of 1918.\n\nDecades passed, and the school remained a silent witness to the undulating rhythms sovereign Turkestan. It stood dormant until the present moment, when the birth of the National Guard breathed life into its timeworn corridors. The decision was made to resurrect this bastion of military education. Under the National Guard's banner, the school reopened its doors. Gone were the days of nobility as admission transcended social strata. With an expanded curriculum and advanced training programs, the Tashkent Military School emerged as a symbol of modernity, poised to shape a new generation of officers.  The opening ceremony, attended by dignitaries and military leaders, marked a poignant moment in Turkestan's history. As the national flag fluttered over the Tashkent Military School, it symbolized not just military training but a commitment to shaping leaders who would safeguard the values of a new, sovereign Turkestan."
turkestan.225.a: "Glory to the National Guard!"

turkestan.226.t: "The Qyzylqum Race"
turkestan.226.d: "An unusual situation recently arose in the government while discussing the equipping of a unique troop of specialized camel divisions. During the procurement discussions, a famous camel breeder from a distant Egyptian oasis, known for his pedigree of elite royal camels, approached the military with a proposal. These were not ordinary camels, but a rare breed renowned for its exceptional speed, endurance and adaptability to the harsh desert conditions. The breeder offered a deal that went beyond the traditional ways of acquiring equipment and . shall we say, means of transportation. His condition was simple but intriguing - instead of the usual deal, he wanted to demonstrate the prowess of his elite camels in a grand spectacle - a race across the vastness of the Qyzylqum desert. The military leadership, intrigued and perhaps amused by the proposal, accepted the challenge. The race took place in the arid dunes of Qyzylqum, reflecting the harsh reality of possible warfare. Half an hour after the hooves of these majestic creatures rumbled across the desert, the winner was decided. The breeder's elite camels had outrun the camels of our military. The military, true to their commitment, recognized the superiority of these animals and struck a deal. The elite camels became valuable new members of the Turkestan Camel Corps"
turkestan.226.a: "A bit unusual way to sell."

turkestan.227.t: "The Night Guards"
turkestan.227.d: "Originating from a legacy that dates back to the XVIII century, the Mirshabs were the nocturnal custodians of Turkestan, patrolling bustling streets and squares of its ancient cities. Their responsibilities extended beyond conventional law enforcement, encompassing the maintenance of public order, resolution of conflicts, and the meticulous scrutiny of market scales. In Turkestan's past, they stood as the bastions of law and order, invoking both respect and apprehension. As Turkestan declared its first taste of independence in 1917, the Mirshabs evolved into local militia units, becoming the sole armed forces in the region, excluding the illegal paramilitaries associated with radical movements and the Mujahideen. Led by Ergash Bey, these contemporary Mirshabs posed a quandary to the government's vision of stability.\n\nThe term \"Mirshab\" itself signifyed the chief of the night guards of the city — a position that had evolved over centuries. From ensuring fair market practices to meting out punishments, they were both the architects and enforcers of a unique form of justice. Yet, with the emergence of Ergash Bey as their leader, the allegiance of the Mirshabs to the government became ambiguous. The dichotomy between civic duty and paramilitary inclinations blurred, leaving the government with a multifaceted challenge. Within the hallowed halls of government chambers, discussions unfolded, presenting several divergent paths forward.\n\nAdvocates for integration proposed absorbing the Mirshabs into the official security apparatus. Under this plan, they would be provided with clearly defined roles and responsibilities, operating under the watchful eye of the National Guard. The aim was to leverage their local knowledge for the greater good, albeit with reservations about the potential influence of Qadimism and Islamism. An alternative perspective favored dismantling the Mirshabs entirely, paving the way for the creation of a new civic policing force under government control. This approach aimed to sever any lingering ties to paramilitary influences and ensure unwavering loyalty to the government."
turkestan.227.a: "Disband the Mirshabs!"
turkestan.227.b: "Integrate the Mirshabs and oversight them."

turkestan.228.t: "Mirshab Insurgency"
turkestan.228.d: "As the government, faced with uncertainties regarding the loyalty of the Mirshabs, took the pivotal decision to disband them, a tempest was unleashed. Ergash Bey, the field commander of Turkestan Mirshabs, saw this not as a cessation but as a call to arms. His Mirshabs, a potent blend of enforcers and paramilitaries, were not to be relegated to history without a struggle. The disbandment order, seen as a challenge to their existence and influence, fueled the flames of dissent. The Mirshabs, under the command of Ergash Bey, regrouped and declared an insurgency. Ergash Bey has rallied his loyalists, transforming the disbandment into a rallying cry for those who saw the Mirshabs not as relics but as essential pillars of order. The insurgency unfolded as a complex dance, with covert meetings, clandestine operations, and the deployment of Mirshabs loyal to Ergash. Turkestan, already grappling with internal divisions, now faced a surge of unrest from a force that had, for decades, held sway over matters of law and order."

turkestan.230.t: "Birth of the Academy of Sciences"
turkestan.230.d: "In the tapestry of time woven across Tashkent's intellectual landscape, the dawn of the 20th century cast its glow upon the burgeoning need for higher education in Turkestan. As the region experienced rapid development, fueled by the growing number of educated individuals emerging from institutions like the Tashkent and Samarkand gymnasiums, Tashkent real school, and teacher's seminary, the aspiration for a university that met the highest standards of the era took root. The vision for such an institution had been nurtured since 1914, with meticulous preparations underway. However, the specter of the Weltkrieg disrupted these ambitious plans. Undeterred, the clamor for a higher education hub persisted. Thus, the III Regional Congress of Soviets of Turkestan, convened in November 1917, resolved to establish a higher educational institution in Tashkent. On February 17, 1918, the constituent assembly of the Tashkent Society of Higher Education zealots convened, drawing representatives from esteemed societies such as the Russian Geographical and Technical Societies, the Tashkent Society of Naturalists and Doctors, the Tashkent Pedagogical and Legal Societies, the Turkestan Agricultural Society, the Society of Muslim Teachers, Polytechnic Courses, and the Provincial Teachers' Union. The culmination of these efforts materialized on March 9, 1918, when the Council of People's Commissars of Turkestan decided to establish a People's University, under the aegis of the Commissary of Education. The university found its abode in the premises of the military school and the palace of Grand Duke N. K. Romanov. A beacon of education emerged with the formation of the university's council on March 11, 1918, with A. V. Popov assuming the directorship and the esteemed agronomist Richard Schroeder as deputy director. In a Old Tashkent part of the city, the Muslim section of the People's University opened its doors on May 12, 1918, attracting 945 eager minds. This inclusive section endeavored to pioneer women's education, establishing four schools for women and cultivating a nurturing environment for children of school and pre-school age.\n\nThe journey continued, and in 1922, by the decree of the [TRK_get_majlis_name], the Turkestan State University emerged from the crucible of the People's University, perpetuating the flame of knowledge. As the winds of change swept across the academic landscape, the government, fueled by additional resources, envisioned a grander institution — the Academy of Sciences. At the helm of this new intellectual bastion stood Toshmuhammad Qari-Niyoziy. His journey, initiated in the Russian-indigenous school in Fergana in 1916, embraced roles as a teacher, founder of the first elementary school in Turkestan, and a pivotal contributor to the establishment of the inaugural Turkestan pedagogical technical school in Kokand. Graduating from the Turkestan State University's Physics and Mathematics Department in 1929, he ascended to the role of professor and ultimately became the university's rector from 1931. The establishment of the Academy of Sciences was not merely a structural addition but a testament to the relentless pursuit of enlightenment in Turkestan — a celebration of intellect, progress, and the indomitable spirit of education."
turkestan.230.a: "A great development!"

turkestan.231.t: "Richard Schroeder - A Pioneer of Agricultural Science in Turkestan"
turkestan.231.d: "Born into an academic family on October 15, 1867, in Moscow, Richard Schroeder laid the foundations of his scientific journey from a young age. His father, a professor at the Petrovsky Academy of Agriculture and Forestry, instilled in him a love for knowledge. In 1887, after completing his studies at the 4th gymnasium, Richard embarked on a journey into the realm of natural sciences at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics at Moscow University. Graduating with honors in 1891, Richard's academic prowess led him to the Petrov Agricultural Academy, where he further honed his expertise in agronomy. His insatiable curiosity and dedication to scientific inquiry were evident in works such as "\The relation of winter breads to phosphorus fertilizers" and "To the question of protein synthesis with higher plants.\" In 1900, armed with a master's degree from Moscow University, Richard set out on a three-year scientific sojourn in Germany and Switzerland. There, under the tutelage of esteemed professors, he delved into the intricacies of plant physiology and the physiological chemistry of plants. A turning point in Richard's career came when he expressed a desire to contribute his agricultural expertise where it was needed most. Turkestan, with its pressing need for agronomic assistance, became the canvas for his next chapter. In 1902, the Ministry of Agriculture dispatched Richard to lead the Turkestan Agricultural Experimental Station.\n\nIn Turkestan, Richard's commitment went beyond scientific exploration. He immersed himself in the local culture, mastering the Uzbek language to understand the nuances of age-old farming practices. The experimental station, dormant before his arrival, blossomed into a hub of scientific activity under his guidance. Richard's impact on agriculture extended beyond the borders of Turkestan. His journey to the United States in 1911 for an International Congress on Agriculture solidified his reputation on the global stage. His report on \"California Fruit Growing\" not only showcased his broad perspectives but also drew attention to the agricultural potential of Central Asia. The station, now under Richard's stewardship, undertook groundbreaking research in horticulture. Over 200 varieties of apples, pears, and other fruits underwent scrutiny, laying the groundwork for acclimatization efforts in Central Asia. His studies extended to viticulture, climatology, and the creation of the first-ever journal in Uzbek language, \"Dehkan\", to disseminate agricultural knowledge. Richard's tireless efforts left an indelible mark on Turkestan's agricultural landscape. His legacy as a pioneering scientist, editor, and advocate for sustainable farming practices continues to inspire generations. His commitment to bridging scientific knowledge with practical agriculture established him as a luminary in the annals of Turkestan's agricultural history."

turkestan.232.t: "The Resurgence of Karkara Fair"
turkestan.232.d: "In a revival of historical commerce and cultural exchange, the Karkara Fair, once a bustling hub in the late 19th to early 20th centuries, is set to reopen its gates. Nestled between Jarkent and Qaraqol counties, the fair was a melting pot of diverse influences, attracting Chinese, Khivan, Bukharan, Tajik, Turkmen, Kyrgyz and Russian merchants. The fair's origin can be traced back to the nomadic area of Kazakhs from the Alban clan, known as Karkara. With its bustling atmosphere, the fair became a vital economic and cultural crossroads. Russian merchants brought European goods to [589.GetName], while local Kazakh nomads brought their livestock, engaging in a vibrant exchange of goods and resources.\n\nHowever, the fair's vibrant history took a somber turn in 1916. In response to the Tsar's decree on conscription, representatives of the Alban clan gathered on Mount Akbeit, refusing to comply. Tensions escalated, leading to arrests and armed struggles. The fair, once a symbol of trade and unity, fell silent as the region plunged into rebellion.\n\nNow, as the echoes of the past reverberate, the decision to reopen the Karkara Fair represents more than just an economic endeavor. It is a testament to the resilience of communities and the restoration of historical connections. As merchants, nomads, and communities prepare to converge once again, the fair becomes a living testament to the enduring spirit of connection and trade that defines Turkestan."

turkestan_national_union.1.t: "Shokay's Gamble"
turkestan_national_union.1.d: "The dust of the civil war had barely settled, and the echoes of conflict still lingered in the air. Shokay, now at the helm of a beleaguered Turkestan, recognized the fragility of the post-war landscape. The ghosts of dissent and the looming specter of chaos necessitated decisive action. With a vision to prevent the recurrence of civil strife, Shokay set his eyes on the nucleus of power — the executive office. His proposal was audacious, aiming to significantly expand the scope of his authority. The move, while viewed as necessary by his staunch supporters, sent ripples of apprehension through the populace. Accusations of tyranny echoed in the alleyways, raising concerns about the preservation of democratic ideals in the new Turkestan.\n\nHowever, Shokay, pragmatic in his approach, opted to navigate the treacherous waters with a degree of democratic legitimacy. The Khalq Majlisi, Turkestan's parliamentary institution, became the battleground for the clash of ideals. Shokay, seeking to bolster not only his own authority but also the stature of the Milliy Ittihod party, presented the case for an empowered executive office. The halls of the Khalq Majlisi buzzed with fervent debate and impassioned speeches. Supporters rallied behind Shokay's vision, highlighting the need for a strong hand to guide Turkestan into stability. Opposition voices, however, cried foul, labeling the move as a dangerous shift towards authoritarianism. The outcome of the Khalq Majlisi vote hung in the balance, a delicate dance of political maneuvering. Shokay, cognizant of the stakes, understood that the success of his proposal could shape the destiny of a nascent nation. The future of Turkestan teetered on the precipice of choice, as the parliament weighed the balance between authority and democracy."

turkestan_national_union.2.t: "Khalq Majlisi of Turkestan"
turkestan_national_union.2.d: "The echoing chambers of Khalq Majlisi resonated with the complex political landscape of Turkestan. Comprising 54 members, the assembly was a mosaic of diverse identities, split into two curias reflecting the religious composition of the region. On one side stood the 36 representatives of the majority Muslim population, encompassing Uzbeks, Tajiks, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and Pamir peoples. Opposite them were the 18 members representing the Russian and Jewish communities. In the delicate dance of political affiliations, the Milliy Ittihod held a slight majority with 21 members. Yet, Shokay found himself at a crossroads, seeking to push through the \"Executive Empowerment Act\" that would significantly expand his powers. The Qadimist conservatives of Ittifoqi Muslimin, numbering 20, presented a formidable bloc, raising doubts about unanimous party support. The remaining members, scattered between ERK and non-partisans, added another layer of uncertainty to the vote. The non-Muslim representatives, particularly the Russians, carried the weight of the Turkestan Military Organisation's influence. Their allegiance was a delicate balance that required careful and strategic lobbying. As Shokay navigated the intricacies of parliamentary politics, the fate of the Executive Empowerment Act hung in the balance. Every vote became a potential pivot point, and alliances within the Majlisi would play a crucial role in shaping the future trajectory of Turkestan."

turkestan_national_union.3.d: "The air in the negotiation room hung heavy with anticipation as representatives from the Milliy Ittihod and Ittifoqi Muslimin gathered to discuss the fate of the Executive Empowerment Act. The coalition, though fragile, held the promise of unity in a post-civil war Turkestan. Ittifoqi Muslimin, embodying conservative values and traditions, sought assurances that their ideological principles would be upheld in the new era. The core demand from Ittifoqi Muslimin was a commitment to align governance and legislation with Sharia principles. This encompassed both civil and criminal laws, ensuring that the legal framework adhered to Islamic tenets. Furthermore, a critical component of the negotiations revolved around education. Ittifoqi Muslimin sought to influence the educational curriculum, emphasizing the teaching of Islamic values and history, as well as limiting the Jadidist influence of the new-Method schools. Moreover, our coalition partners emphasized economic policies rooted in Islamic economic principles, such as reducing interest-based transactions, promoting equity, and supporting businesses aligned with conservative values."
turkestan_national_union.3.d2: "The negotiation room bore witness to a tense atmosphere as representatives from the Milliy Ittihod and Ittifoqi Muslimin grappled with the remnants of a fractured alliance. The scars of past betrayals were still fresh, and the demands presented by Ittifoqi Muslimin carried the weight of their ideological convictions and a history of shifting allegiances. Ittifoqi Muslimin pressed for a direct role in overseeing the adherence to Islamic principles in governance. This demand aimed not only at ideological alignment but also sought to establish a mechanism to prevent future deviations from their shared values. Moreover, our coalition partners emphasized economic policies rooted in Islamic economic principles, such as reducing interest-based transactions, promoting equity, and supporting businesses aligned with conservative values. Acknowledging the breach in trust, Ittifoqi Muslimin proposed terms for reparations. These included public recognition of their grievances, a commitment to rectify past injustices, and a pledge to rebuild the trust that had been eroded during their prior alignment with Madamin-Bey."

turkestan_national_union.5.d: "In the intricate tapestry of Turkestan's history, the Vadhyaev family emerged as key players, their origins traced back to Bukhara, where the Jewish community navigated the intricate web of discriminatory measures imposed by the Muslim majority. Despite these challenges, the Vadhyaevs thrived in trade, particularly in the realm of dyes. Legend whispers that a fortuitous shipment from Russia brought them unexpected wealth, propelling them into the echelons of influence. Haim Vadhyaev, the patriarch, laid the foundation for a thriving family business in the dye trade. His sons, including Isaac-Borukh, Neryo, Zion, and Yakub, inherited the mantle and expanded their endeavors. Yakub and Sion achieved unparalleled success, transforming their family firm into the formidable \"Vadhyaev Brothers\" trading house. The brothers exhibited exceptional acumen, venturing beyond trade to establish a textile combine with the acquisition of the Ivanovo-Voznesenskaya manufactory. In the nascent days of Turkestan autonomy in 1917 under Mustafa Shokay, Yakub Vadhyaev even held a ministerial role, embodying the intertwining of economic influence and political collaboration.\n\nNow, as Turkestan emerged from the crucible of civil war, the Vadhyaev brothers wielded their economic prowess, seeking assurances and subsidies for their company, a request deeply intertwined with their historic contributions. The Vadhyaev brothers pressed for substantial financial subsidies to bolster their textile combine, citing their pivotal role in supporting Mustafa Shokay's government during the turbulence of the civil war. Recognizing their economic significance, the brothers sought assurances of stability in trade policies and economic conditions. This encompassed protection from arbitrary regulations and a conducive environment for their businesses to thrive. To safeguard their interests, the Vadhyaevs requested representation in key economic committees. This move aimed at securing their influence in decision-making processes that could impact their economic ventures. As proponents of charitable endeavors, the Vadhyaevs urged for government support in infrastructure development, especially in areas where their businesses held sway. This included requests for improved transport networks and utilities."

turkestan_national_union.6.t: "Faith in the Balance"
turkestan_national_union.6.d: "The decision to seek the backing of the influential Vadhyaev brothers resonates through the streets, stirring a fervor among the Muslim population. Voices of dissent rise, as faithful believers gather to express their concerns. The decision to align with the wealthy Jewish community has ignited a spark of discontent among the Muslim factions within Ittifoqi Muslimin and Milliy Ittihod. Protesters, driven by religious fervor, demand an explanation from their leaders. The air is charged with tension as the delicate balance between religious principles and political alliances hangs in the balance. The faithful question whether this move compromises the integrity of their cause, and the leaders find themselves navigating the complex terrain of faith and pragmatism.\n\nWith the government in stress, Shokay is presented with a possibility to address the faithful directly, acknowledging their fears and emphasizing the pragmatic necessity of seeking support from the Vadhyaev brothers. Shokay should also publicly state that this alliance is a means to strengthen the country economically and that religious values will not be compromised. Moreover, respected religious leaders should be invited to endorse the decision, hoping to sway public opinion in favor of the practical benefits. On the other hand, a discreet  approach can be chosen. By engaging influential religious leaders in private discussions, we can seek their support and understanding. Shokay aims to convince them that the alliance with the Vadhyaev brothers is a temporary necessity for the greater good. By gaining the support of key religious figures, he hopes to quell the unrest among the Muslim population without openly challenging the decision in the public domain."

The party, founded on Jadidist principles, finds itself torn between the vision of its founder, Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan, and Shokay's pragmatic approach. Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan, the venerable founder and current foreign minister, leads the dissenting faction. He, along with the more liberal members of the party, perceives Shokay's initiatives as a departure from the Jadidist ideals that once inspired the party's inception. The group emphasizes the need to reclaim these principles, advocating for a more decentralized, participatory governance structure. Shokay faces a direct challenge from the Jadidist faction. They demand the reinstatement of Jadidist principles within the party's manifesto, decrying what they see as a drift toward a Russophile stance. Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan insists on the appointment of Shoh-Islom Shagiahmetov, a respected Jadidist educator, as the new minister of education. On the other hand, Shokay can turn to a more populist and pragmatic approach. He can appeal directly to the party's grassroots members, organizing town hall meetings and rallies to gather support for the Act. Shokay emphasizes the urgency of a strong government to lead Turkestan through post-war reconstruction and economic recovery. He taps into the party's nationalist sentiments, framing the Act as a necessary step for a robust, independent Turkestan."

The air thickened with anticipation, and the eyes of the parliamentarians bore the weight of the nation's destiny. Minister-President of Turkestan, fueled by the desire for a firm grip on the reins of power, presented the Executive Empowerment Act. The proposal, however, sent ripples of unease through the assembly, as its authoritarian undertones reverberated in the hallowed halls. As the details unfolded, Shokay advocated for an all-encompassing authority, concentrating power tightly around the Presidency. The Act, in its authoritarian form, included clauses empowering the president to unilaterally enact laws and dissolve the parliament at will. Shokay argued that such measures were imperative for rapid recovery and stability, and debarment of the future civil conflict.\n\nWithin the parliament, reactions were varied. The Milliy Ittihod members, some loyal to Shokay, some not, found themselves at odds with the departure from the Jadidist and democratic principles. The ERK members, survivors of the tumultuous events, observed with caution. The specter of authoritarianism, a shadow from the past, loomed over their deliberations. Non-partisan members, embodying diverse opinions, grappled with the delicate balance between stability and individual freedoms, especially for their communities. The Qadimist members frown on the Minister-President. As Shokay concluded his presentation, the chamber became a crucible of dissent. Aware of the mounting concerns, Shokay opened the floor for discussion. The Qadimist conservatives, in an attempt to salvage the democratic principles, suggested a more balanced approach. This alternative proposal sought to dilute the authoritarian amendments, introducing checks and balances. It called for parliamentary approval on significant decisions, limiting the president's ability to unilaterally wield power. Debate ensued as the parliamentarians wrestled with the two conflicting visions. The fate of the nation hinged on this crucial decision, and the delicate dance between authority and democracy unfolded within the hallowed halls of the Khalq Majlisi."

The resonating echoes of parliamentary voices marked the inception of a new era, one that would redefine the balance of power in Turkestan. Mustafa Shokay, having secured the legal arsenal to strengthen his grasp on authority, wasted no time in wielding the newfound powers. The first stroke of his executive brush was to cancel the elections, temporary, until the government believes that the situation is stable enough.\n\nThe move triggered a storm of dissent within the Milliy Ittihod party. A vocal faction, led by the charismatic Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan, vehemently opposed Shokay's decision. Abdurrashidkhan, an ardent defender of Jadidist principles, rallied against what he saw as a departure from the party's foundational ideals. The party, once united in purpose, now found itself at the crossroads of ideological schism. Simultaneously, the dissent echoed beyond party lines. Ittifoqi Muslimin, once aligned with Shokay's government, declared a 'full break.' The radicals within the party condemned the majority in the parliament for succumbing to Shokay's vision. The air was thick with discontent, yet even if they united in opposition, the numbers weren't in their favor to pass a no-confidence motion. The stage was set for a political showdown, with the looming elections casting a shadow over the aspirations of Shokay's adversaries. The Emergency Empowerment Act had carved a path towards an era of authority, but the turbulence within the parliament hinted at challenges yet to come. The journey towards a new Turkestan had begun, and the choices made in the corridors of power would shape the nation's destiny."

turkestan_national_union.11.d: "In the hallowed chambers of the Khalq Majlisi, the fate of the Emergency Empowerment Act hung in the balance. The air was thick with tension as the legislators grappled with the implications of granting unprecedented authority to Mustafa Shokay. The very essence of Turkestan's democratic principles was at stake. As the parliamentary debate unfolded, a coalition of dissent emerged. United against the perceived abuse of power, the Qadimists joined forces with the faction of Milliy Ittihod staunchly opposed to Shokay's authoritarian inclinations. Together, they presented a formidable front against the proposed act. The debates echoed through the chambers, filled with impassioned arguments and fervent pleas for the preservation of democratic values. The balance tipped, and the act faced overwhelming condemnation. The parliament, in a moment of resolute decision, passed a vote of no-confidence in Shokay's government. The repercussions reverberated beyond the parliamentary walls. The Qadimists, in alliance with the opposition faction, declared their intent to seek justice through the legal avenues available. Accusations of power abuse were thrust upon Shokay and his closest aides. The corridors of justice would soon bear witness to the unfolding drama of a leader brought to account for his actions.\n\nWith the passage of the vote of no-confidence, Shokay's resignation became inevitable. The constitutional order designated the acting president, Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan, the responsibility of navigating Turkestan through the turbulent waters. In his announcement, Abdurrashidkhan not only declared snap elections but emphasized the commitment to restoring the democratic ethos that Turkestan held dear. The fall of authority had rung through the parliamentary halls, setting the stage for a fresh chapter in Turkestan's history. The journey towards renewal and democratic resurgence had commenced, shaped by the choices made in the face of power's delicate balance."

turkestan_national_union.12.d: "Within the Milliy Ittihod party, the echoes of discontent had grown into a resounding call for change. The majority, led by the more liberal and jadidist factions, had decided that Mustafa Shokay's vision for Turkestan no longer aligned with the party's foundational principles. A decision was reached: Shokay and his loyalists were to be formally removed from the party. As the party majority executed this internal cleansing, Shokay found himself ousted from the political stronghold he once commanded. The air was thick with tension as party members, torn between loyalty to their charismatic leader and adherence to the party's core tenets, made a choice that would redefine the political landscape of Turkestan. However, Shokay, resilient and determined, did not retreat into political oblivion. Instead, he seized the moment to announce the birth of a new movement — 'Yosh Turkiston,' or 'Young Turkestan'. Embracing Pan-Turkism and emphasizing social unity and stability, Shokay sought to carve a distinct ideological space for his followers. The stage was set for a political showdown, with the former allies now facing off as rivals. The rift in the ranks of Milliy Ittihod had not only reshaped the party but had given birth to a new force in Turkestan's politics."

turkestan_national_union.13.d: "The Qadimists, staunch in their convictions, pushed for legal action against Mustafa Shokay, asserting that his tenure had been marred by abuses of power. The government, now under the leadership of Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan, convened a special committee to deliberate on the crucial question: To sue or not to sue.\n\nThe atmosphere was charged with the weight of responsibility as committee members presented their arguments. Those in favor of legal action emphasized the need for accountability, arguing that a failure to act might set a precedent for unchecked power. The Qadimists, true to their conservative ideals, believed that the law must be upheld, irrespective of the political ramifications. On the other side of the table, opposing voices raised concerns about the potential backlash. They warned that a legal battle might exacerbate the existing political divisions, fueling tensions in an already fragile Turkestan. The specter of unrest and the possibility of Shokay's supporters rallying against the government cast a shadow over the decision. The committee grappled with the dilemma, weighing the scales of justice against the delicate stability of the nation. As they navigated the intricate web of legal and political consequences, each member carried the burden of choosing between the pursuit of justice and the preservation of a tenuous peace."

Unwilling to face the consequences of his actions, Shokay orchestrated a daring escape from Turkestan, evading the clutches of the justice system. Details emerged of a clandestine operation that involved trusted confidantes and covert routes. Shokay, once the symbol of authority, slipped away under the cover of darkness, leaving behind a nation in the throes of legal reckoning.\n\nAs the news of Shokay's escape reverberated through Turkestan, the court proceedings unfolded nonetheless. The legal machinery, undeterred by the absence of its primary defendant, moved forward. Mustafa Shokay was tried in absentia, a symbolic act of accountability for the alleged abuses of power during his rule. The courtroom became a stage for legal theatrics as Shokay's defense team presented a vigorous case on his behalf. The attorneys argued that the charges were politically motivated, a desperate attempt by rivals to tarnish Shokay's legacy. They claimed that the former leader had acted within the bounds of executive authority, framing his decisions as necessary measures to maintain stability in a tumultuous time. Despite Shokay's absence, his defense team marshaled every available argument, challenging the validity of the charges and questioning the impartiality of the judiciary. The trial unfolded as a battle of narratives, with the prosecution striving to hold a leader accountable and the defense painting a picture of a persecuted patriot. As the court weighed the evidence and the arguments, the nation watched, holding its collective breath, torn between the pursuit of justice and the echoes of a tumultuous past."

Apparently, it happened to be that one of the refugees was closely resembling the ex-president of [FROM.GetName], Mustafa Shokay, who was in hiding due to the criminal procedure against him. After several hours of interrogation, this person made full admission that he really is Mustafa Shokay and he asked for asylum within our country. This case was immediately brought to [ROOT.GetLeader] and the discussion began. Some have suggested that due to our relations with Turkestan we should definetely deliver him to Turkestan authorities. The others, however, suggested that perhaps keeping him in our country means we can later establish a collaboration movement in [FROM.GetName], friendly towards us, as Shokay would likely create an exile movement of his own, considering his great political ambitions."

The once-mighty ruler found himself in the hands of the very justice system he had attempted to evade. Upon his arrival, Shokay was promptly arrested and escorted to a Turkestani courtroom to face the consequences of his actions. The nation, still grappling with the aftermath of his rule, watched intently as the legal proceedings unfolded. The court, now with Shokay physically present, embarked on the final phase of a long and tumultuous legal battle. The charges of power abuse, corruption, and violations of democratic principles were meticulously laid out before the judges. As the prosecution and defense presented their cases, the courtroom became a stage for the culmination of Turkestan's quest for justice. The nation awaited the court's decree, yearning for closure and the assurance that those who wielded power would be held accountable. In the hallowed halls of justice, where the echoes of Shokay's autocratic rule still lingered, the court deliberated.

He declared the creation of the 'Turkestan Democratic Front,' a movement he asserted to be the legitimate voice of exiles committed to restoring stability and order in Turkestan. Shokay's appearance sent shockwaves through the Turkestani government, prompting swift condemnation of the country that had hosted him. The official statement labeled Shokay's actions as an affront to Turkestan's sovereignty and a blatant disregard for the legal processes that had played out in the homeland. The Turkestan government, in a unified response, underscored its commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring justice prevailed. Shokay's attempt to rally support from abroad was met with skepticism domestically, as many questioned the legitimacy of an exiled movement seeking to influence the affairs of a sovereign nation."

The judges meticulously outlined the evidence presented during the trial, emphasizing instances where Shokay's actions were deemed to have overstepped constitutional boundaries. The courtroom fell into a hushed silence as the judgment was pronounced. Shokay, once a formidable political figure, now faced the prospect of legal repercussions. The judges, taking into account the severity of the offenses, have sentenced him to a significant term of imprisonment. The impact of the conviction rippled through Turkestan's political landscape. Milliy Ittihod, the party that had once rallied behind Shokay, saw this as a validation of their concerns. Ittifoqi Muslimin, standing on the opposing side, welcomed the verdict as a triumph of justice. They called for a reevaluation of the political landscape, positioning themselves as advocates for ethical governance and the rule of law. Shokay's newly formed movement, Yosh Turkiston, faced an uphill battle. With its leader now convicted, the movement struggled to maintain its momentum. The charismatic figurehead's fall from grace cast a shadow over the viability of Yosh Turkiston as a political force."

The controversial Executive Empowerment Act, which had sparked heated debates, was found to be in alignment with the recommendations of the constitutional committee. The courtroom buzzed with a mix of astonishment and disbelief as the decision reverberated through the nation. Shokay, once facing the prospect of severe consequences, emerged from the legal ordeal unscathed.\n\nMilliy Ittihod, the party that had once rallied behind Shokay, now deeply dissatisfied with the verdict, contemplated its next move. Ittifoqi Muslimin, standing on the opposite side, expressed their discontent with the outcome, questioning the integrity of the legal system. The turbulence within the political landscape was palpable, and the aftermath of the trial cast a long shadow over the nation. The acquittal not only solidified Shokay's position but also intensified the political polarization within Turkestan.

The atmosphere was heavy with history as a prosecutor, armed with legal doctrines, presented the charges against Madamin-Bey. His attempt to establish a parallel government, armed resistance, and refusal to acknowledge the Turkestan Republic's authority were laid bare. Shokay's advisors engaged in hushed debates, contemplating the legal intricacies and the political ramifications of the impending decision. The President, stoic in his countenance, faced a momentous choice. To prosecute Madamin-Bey would assert the rule of law, a resolute message against acts of defiance. Yet, leniency might be seen as a gesture of reconciliation, fostering unity in a nation scarred by rebellion. The legal foundation for the decision rested on the argument that the Provisional Fergana Government, despite its two-decade existence, had violated established laws, especially in areas beyond the Turkestan Republic's jurisdiction."

The air was heavy with anticipation as the courtroom, adorned in deep mahogany and bathed in solemnity, bore witness to a spectacle that would carve its mark on Turkestan's tapestry. The prosecutor, a zealous advocate for the Turkestan Republic, stood resolute. He painted a vivid narrative of Madamin-Bey's defiance, harking back to the early days of the Provisional Fergana Government. The opening arguments dissected the establishment of the rival government, its defiance of Turkestan's legal authority, and the subsequent unrest that had plagued the region.\n\nThe courtroom murmured in quiet contemplation as witnesses took the stand. They recounted tales of armed resistance, acts of insubordination, and territories where the Turkestan Republic's laws held no sway. The prosecution deftly wove a tapestry of rebellion, portraying Madamin-Bey as an architect of chaos. As the trial progressed, dates and locations came to life. The tumultuous years from 1919 to 1936 were laid bare, each instance a building block in the edifice of Madamin-Bey's alleged crimes. The prosecutor spoke of events that transpired in Osh, the city of Fergana, and Jalal-Abad, the very bastions of the Provisional Fergana Government. Witness testimonies, some emotional, others stoic, painted a mosaic of defiance that had echoed through the decades. The defense, equally adept, sought to unveil the complexities beneath the surface. They delved into the political climate, the grievances that birthed the rival government, and the territories where Turkestan's reach faltered. The climax of the trial approached, and the courtroom hung in palpable tension. The judge, adorned in black robes, assumed the mantle of arbiter.

As the trial unfurled, it aimed to untangle the threads of Monstrov's involvement in the Provisional Fergana Government and his leadership of the 'Fergana Peasant Army'.\n\nKonstantin Monstrov, a charismatic and fervent leader, was not an unfamiliar name in the turbulent chronicles of Turkestan. As the curtain lifted on his trial, the prosecution painted a vivid portrait of a man, ethnic Russian, authority among the Russian peasant settlers, a fighter, with long mustache, but most importantly - a man who had played a pivotal role in the formation of the Provisional Fergana Government two decades prior. The court delved into Monstrov's political aspirations, connections to Turkestan Military Organisation and the Russian Government, his affiliations with Madamin-Bey, and the vision that fueled the establishment of the rival government in the Fergana Valley. The prosecution emphasized Monstrov's alleged orchestration of a movement that challenged the authority of the Turkestan Republic.\n\nThe 'Fergana Peasant Army', an armed force purportedly led by Monstrov, stood accused of sowing dissent, evading tax obligations, and illegal black market trade and arms smuggling. Witnesses, mostly Muslims, stepped forward to share their accounts. They spoke of Monstrov's influence, the sway he held over the disenchanted masses of Russian 'colonialists', and the military might he allegedly commanded. The defense, in turn, sought to present Monstrov as a champion of the people, someone who stood against perceived injustices and grievances not only of the Bolsheviks, but also of the Mujahideen. As the trial reached its crescendo, the judge, a stern arbiter of justice, pondered the weight of history. The verdict, resonating through the hallowed halls, pronounced Konstantin Monstrov..."

The courtroom became a trial by proxy for a figure who had vanished beyond the borders. The charges against Madamin-Bey, a litany of offenses ranging from sedition to rebellion, were laid bare, creating an eerie tableau. The absentia trial unfolded with the prosecution meticulously building a case against the fugitive leader, summoning witnesses and presenting a narrative woven from the threads of evidence. The judge presided over a trial where the accused's seat remained vacant, a symbolic reminder of the escape that had left justice in pursuit of shadows. The legal proceedings scrutinized the legacy of the Provisional Fergana Government, dissecting its actions and aspirations in the harsh light of legal scrutiny. The organization, now stripped of its ephemeral authority, faced the solemn condemnation of the court for its audacious challenge to the sovereignty of the Turkestan Republic.

Realizing that direct confrontation could lead to unrest, a subtle strategic play was chosen to weaken the influence of the TMO on ethnic Russian communities. Shokay, adept at navigating political intricacies, used legal channels to limit the influence of the TVOs. By initiating laws aimed at regulating paramilitary organizations, he sought to clip the wings of the TVO without coming into direct conflict with its leadership. This legal maneuvering was a calculated gamble, a test of water in Turkestan's evolving political landscape. At the same time, Shokay reached out to ethnic Russian leaders, emphasizing the idea of shared governance. Promises of increased representation and cultural preservation were delicately woven into his speech to touch the feelings of a community that felt increasingly marginalized. The media played a key role in this campaign. Shokay strategically used state-controlled media and Russian-language newspapers to cover cases of TWO excesses, subtly framing them as a threat to the entire population. A carefully constructed narrative aimed to shift public opinion away from the influence of the TVO."

With the help of laws and increased work by the security services, the influence of the TVOs was reduced and forced them to conspire more strongly, but their presence was still felt, taking away any hope for a peaceful resolution of the issue."

As the scent of rich Central Asian tea wafted through the room, [ROOT.GetLeader] addressed the gathered leaders, acknowledging the delicate nature of the matter. The Stolypin reform's legacy had woven Russian settlements into the fabric of the Fergana Valley, creating a complex challenge for the sovereign Turkestan. Amidst the ornate tapestries that adorned the walls, the discussions oscillated between assimilation and repatriation. President has emphasized the importance of unity within diversity. He spoke of a vision where Russian settlers and local Muslims coexisted, contributing to the shared prosperity of the newly formed republic. \"Our republic is not monocultural, and we must ensure every thread is woven with care. Assimilation is not a compromise; it's an acknowledgment of our shared destiny,\" the President declared. However, opposition voices within the government argued for repatriation. They feared the lingering influence of Russian settlers, viewing them as remnants of a colonial past that could hinder the realization of Turkestan's vision. \"Our struggle for independence should not be compromised by the shadows of colonialism. Let us repatriate those who wish to return, ensuring our republic is shaped by its own people,\" was the point of the other side.\n\nThe air in the room thickened with tension as passionate arguments resonated within the chamber.

The first whispers of discontent among the peasants spread like wildfire, and Monstrov seized the moment. With a fervent call to reclaim their lands and resist what he termed as a betrayal of their struggle, he rallied the disenchanted masses to rise against the government's decision. Under the vast canopy of the ancient Chinar trees, Monstrov's fiery speeches resonated, stoking the flames of resentment. His rhetoric painted a picture of injustice, portraying the government's move as an attempt to erase the sacrifices made by the Fergana Peasant Army in the fight against the Bolsheviks.

A vote by the Central Committee could easily remove him from power, highlighting the delicate balance within ERK. Yet, amidst the uncertainties, the grand ceremony marked the beginning of a journey into the new age."

turkestan_socialists.2.t: "Two-Party \"Solution\""
turkestan_socialists.2.d: "In a historic turn of events, the ERK party and Milliy Ittihod has engaged in high-stakes negotiations to reshape Turkestan's political landscape. The outcome is the dissolution of Milliy Ittihod and the birth of a new entity — the Popular Front. Under this alliance, Milliy Ittihod is reformed as Milliy Istiklol (National Independence) and officially aligns itself with the ERK, pledging allegiance to socialist ideals. Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan, the charismatic leader of Milliy Ittihod, retains his position at the helm of the newly-formed Milliy Istiklol. Alongside his trusted associates, he sets out to integrate the party into the ERK's socialist framework.\n\nHowever, Mustafa Shokay, once a prominent figure within Milliy Ittihod, parts ways with the newly-formed Popular Front. Voicing opposition to the repressive measures taken against liberal-jadidist intelligentsia, Shokay vows to establish a movement dedicated to restoring parliamentarism and democracy in Turkestan. The sucess of these ventures remain uncertain."

turkestan_socialists.3.t: "Finishing the Revolution"
turkestan_socialists.3.d: "In a historic turn of events, the RevCom faction within the ERK exerts its influence over the Central Committee, pushing for the closure of the revolutionary chapter and the establishment of a fully socialist state. The ERK leadership, under the pressure of the RevCom's fervent supporters, decides to bring the revolution to a close. Turkestan is now the People's Republic of Turkestan, marking the culmination of a revolution. The ERK enforces a comprehensive ban on all bourgeois parties in Turkestan, aiming at consolidating power and eliminating potential counter-revolutionary elements. Furthermore, ERK begins the process of building a state structure aligned with revolutionary ideals - revolutionary Councils, inspired by the Soviet model, emerge as the primary pillars of governance. These councils are established at various levels, will ensure direct representation and participation of the working class and peasantry in decision-making processes.\n\nAs said in ERK's official newspaper, soon a comprehensive socialist education program is to be implemented, as well as a cultural revolution, aiming to reshape societal norms and values in alignment with socialist ideals. The closure of the revolutionary chapter marks the beginning of a new era for Turkestan, one defined by socialist principles."

turkestan_socialists.4.t: "The Poetic Manifesto of the ERK"
turkestan_socialists.4.d: "In a momentous gathering of visionaries, as the ERK party was being forged in the crucible of Turkestan's struggle for liberation, its political program emerged as a lyrical testament to the dreams of a united and socialist future. Akhmetzaki Velidi and Toroqul Januzakov, the architects of the program, sought to infuse it with the spirit of the people. To give voice to these revolutionary ideals, they turned to the eloquent pen of Saitqirey Magazon. This poetic manifesto encapsulates the ERK's political program, not merely as a list of doctrines but as a lyrical tapestry woven with the hopes and aspirations of the people of Turkestan. Through Magazon's verses, the ERK's vision resonates as a poetic call to freedom, justice, and the harmonious coexistence of the diverse cultures that define the spirit of Turkestan."

turkestan_socialists.5.t: "The Visionaries of Pan-Turkism"
turkestan_socialists.5.d: "As the ERK party convenes its Sixth Congress, Toroqul Januzakov and Turar Ryskulov, leaders of the ruling faction, known as the 'Circle' or 'Tüde', emerge as the architects of a new era for Turkestan. The name 'Circle' pays tribute to the party's origins when it was initially formed as Turkestan Sosialistlar Tüdesi (Circle of Turkestan Socialists). As the congress unfolds, the 'Tüde' envisions a united Turkestan, resilient against external influences, fostering a sense of shared cultural heritage that transcends historical divisions. Against the backdrop of the recent Civil War, the congress becomes the rallying point for the ERK's commitment to national liberation. Januzakov articulated a resolute stance against Russian expansion and aggression, positioning the party as the defender of Turkestan's liberation and an advocate for democratic norms. As Ryskulov takes center stage, unity becomes the central theme of the congress. The ruling faction pledges to unify all Turkestanis into a single state, liberating Khivan and Bukharan Dehkans and Workers from oppression of Emirs and Khans.\n\nWith overwhelming support from the Sixth Congress, the 'Tüde' solidifies its position within the ERK, though some critics argue that this position is only temporarily secured.."

turkestan_socialists.6.t: "Turkestan's Revolutionary Vanguard"
turkestan_socialists.6.d: "In the wake of the Sixth Congress of the ERK, a prominent opposition faction emerged within the party, led by Nazir Toraqulov. Initially aligned with the Left SR position on economic matters, Toraqulov diverged in his emphasis on Islamic Socialism. For this faction, the Quran serves not only as a defense of their positions but as a guiding light, demanding a holy and pious revolution under the divine grace of Allah.\n\nIn stark contrast to the ruling faction's Pan-Turkism, Toraqulov's group places a greater emphasis on the principles of Islamic socialism, challenging the secularization policies of their counterparts. The faction adamantly rejects alliances with bourgeois parties, such as Milliy Ittihod or other Jadidists, viewing democratic means and parliamentarism as incompatible with their revolutionary goals. Instead, they advocate for a one-party solution and a radical transformation of Turkestan guided by their interpretation of Islamic principles.\n\nDuring the Third Congress of the ERK party, Toraqulov and his supporters consolidated their opposition into the 'Revolutionary Committee.' This faction has successfully united with the revolutionary wing of the Young Bukhara party, which is currently divided between the pro-Tüde Usmon Hodja and the pro-RevCom Fayzulla Hodjaev. The future trajectory of the Revolutionary Committee hinges on determining the leading voice among the Young Bukhara Revolutionaries. The struggle between these factions within the ERK sets the stage for ideological clashes and potential shifts in the party's direction."

turkestan_socialists.7.t: "Architect of Turkestani Socialism"
turkestan_socialists.7.d: "As the Sixth Congress of the ERK unfolds, the towering figure of Akhmetzaki Velidi commands attention. A seasoned leader with a rich history in the quest for autonomy and socialism, Velidi's journey began as the Chief Commander of the Bashkir Host and a key figure in the establishment of independent Bashkurdistan. However, the fall of Bashkurdistan made him realize the limitations of autonomy within the Russian sphere.\n\nIn 1919, fueled by the vision of socialism for Turkic-speaking and Central Asian countries free from Russian influence, Velidi took the initiative to found the ERK party. His partnership with Toroqul Januzakov led to the creation of Tüde, a socialist powerhouse in Turkestan. Velidi's commitment to true independence resonated with many, making Tüde a formidable force within ERK. While Velidi assumed the role of ERK Chairman, he strategically stepped back from direct Turkestan department management. Instead, he embraced roles as Commander in Turkestan Legion (ERK paramilitary forces), Historian-Orientalist, and leader of the Bashkir ERK department. His multifaceted influence extends beyond the party, establishing him as a vital ally for the ruling Tüde faction.\n\nHowever, Velidi's potential departure to lead the fight for Bashkurdistan's national liberation poses a dilemma. Losing this trump card could weaken the main faction's influence, highlighting the delicate balance between Turkestani socialism and broader national liberation aspirations."
turkestan_socialists.7.a: "Truly, a great man."

turkestan_socialists.8.t: "Association of National Movements"
turkestan_socialists.8.d: "One notable faction within the ERK is the so-called 'Association of National Movements', a coalition that seeks to unite various ethnic and national-based groups or parties under the ERK umbrella. The largest components of this faction include the Turkmen Revolutionary People's Party, spearheaded by Gaygysyz Atabayev, a prominent leader hailing from the Yomud tribe. Atabayev aligns with the Left SR political program, placing him ideologically closer to the Revolutionary Committee. Despite their shared socialist stance, the Turkmen Revolutionary People's Party is distinctive within this faction. Another influential entity associated with the 'Association of National Movements' is the Kazakh Üsh-Jüz party. Initially founded with a non-socialist agenda, Üsh-Jüz expressed Russophobic sentiments and advocated for a pan-Turkic orientation. Evolving from the dissatisfaction of the Kazakh intelligentsia with the Alash party's program, Üsh-Jüz's ideology blended Russian SR principles with Islamic traditional movements. Over time, the party embraced socialism while retaining both Pan-Turkist and nationalist slogans. Üsh-Jüz maintains a neutral stance on allegiance within the ERK, reflecting its diverse composition.\n\nWithin this faction, various smaller local movements also contribute to the nuanced political landscape, such as Kyrgyz Socialist Party «Bukara». As the Sixth Congress unfolds, these factions vie for representation and influence, adding depth to the ongoing political discourse within the ERK."

turkestan_socialists.9.t: "Velidi's Departure Sparks Power Struggle"
turkestan_socialists.9.d: "As Akhmetzaki Velidi, the party's founder and Chairman, has departed to lead the struggle for Bashkurdistan's independence, the sudden absence of this key figure sends shockwaves through the party leadership, triggering a power struggle.\n\nThe Opposition, seizing the opportunity, demands a re-election of the party chairman, arguing that Velidi's departure has left a void in the ERK's leadership. The call gains momentum as whispers of discontent echo within the ranks. The Tüde, holding a dominant position in the Central Committee, faces a dilemma. Rejecting the demand risks being perceived as weak and could erode their authority. In a surprising turn, the Revolutionary Committee (RevCom) suggests holding party chairman elections on an extraordinary congress in Tashkent, involving a wider section of ERK members. Despite the Tüde's majority in the Central Committee, the potential backlash forces them to reluctantly agree to the proposal.\n\nThe stage is set for a showdown between factions. The looming congress will determine the new party chairman, a position of immense influence and authority. If the Tüde prevails, it will bolster their standing and solidify their dominance. However, a victory for Nazir Toraqulov and the Opposition could mark a significant shift, potentially tipping the scales in favor of the Revolutionary Committee."

turkestan_socialists.10.t: "Tensions within the Bukharan Socialists"
turkestan_socialists.10.d: "Internal tensions threaten the unity of the revolutionary faction of Young Bukhara - within the ranks of the Bukharan socialists, the fault lines of ethnic, educational, and familial divides are becoming increasingly apparent. At the heart of the discord is a deep-seated rivalry between two prominent figures: Fayzulla Hojaev and Abdulkodyr Muhiddinov. This rivalry is not merely ideological; it is rooted in a longstanding feud between their wealthy families. The escalation of family disputes into an open confrontation intensifies the power struggle within the party. Fayzulla Hojaev, born into the affluent Qasim Sheikh family, carries the legacy of Uzbek millionaire merchants in Bukhara. His unique background, including independent Russian language study and education in Moscow, sets him apart. On the other side of the divide stands Mirza Abdulkodyr Muhiddinov, a scion of the wealthy Muhiddinov family, known for their intellectual pursuits and financial prowess. Fluent in both spoken and written Russian, Abdulkodyr emerges as a formidable figure within the Young Bukharan revolutionaries. As these two influential figures vie for leadership, their personal and familial histories intertwine with the broader struggle for the future direction of the movement. The clash between Fayzulla and Abdulkodyr reflects not only an ideological contest but also the intricate web of relationships, ambitions, and historical grievances shaping the destiny of the Bukharan Socialists."

turkestan_socialists.11.d: "As the ERK consolidates its power in Turkestan, its campaign against fundamentalism and religious extremism reaches a critical juncture with the arrest of Sherali Lapin, a prominent Ulemist affiliated with the Qadimist Ittifoqi Muslimin party - a moderate, if compared to the radicals. This arrest has sparked a heated debate among the top-ranking officials within the ERK about the trajectory of their anti-religious campaigns. The ruling faction, Tüde, led by Toroqul Januzakov, staunchly advocates for the secularization of Turkestan. Their vision entails a clear separation of Muslim influence from the governance structure, relegating it to the cultural sphere.\n\nOpposing this stance, the advocates of Islamic Socialism within the RevCom faction argue that such an approach risks alienating the predominantly Muslim population of Turkestan. They contend that an overtly secular agenda could cast the ERK in the light of the second coming of Bolsheviks, further fueling resentment among the people."

turkestan_socialists.12.d: "In the aftermath of the ERK's ascent to power, a momentous decision looms on the horizon — an overhaul of the electoral system to embrace a councilist model. The councilist reforms entail direct elections of Khalq Majlisi delegates by regional councils, elected by local councils and initially represented by the Dehkans and Workers. As the ERK takes steps to dissolve the existing Khalq Majlisi, paving the way for the implementation of this visionary reform, a subtle but significant debate simmers within the party. The core of the debate lies in the naming of the reformed representative body. The Tüde faction contends that the term 'Majlisi,' with its Islamic connotations, should not be retained in a socialist republic. Proposing a shift towards emphasizing Turkic culture, they advocate for renaming it the Khalq Qurultai, translating to People's Congress or Convocation.\n\nOn the opposing end, the RevCom members argue for a focus on systemic changes rather than symbolic alterations. They believe that highlighting the Muslim cultural aspect remains crucial, and the energy should be directed towards transforming the political structure itself rather than a mere change in nomenclature."

turkestan_socialists.13.d: "The [TRK_get_majlis_name] reverberates with the echoes of a historic debate on land redistribution, fueled by the fervent voices of the Association of National Movements. Since the adoption of the Land Nationalization Act in 1921, accompanied by the Turkestan Constitution, the state has overseen the distribution of land, ensuring stability and peace in the agricultural sector. However, dissatisfaction simmers within the Association of National Movements, echoing concerns that certain ethnic communities received disproportionately less land compared to the majority Uzbek and Kazakh populations. In their perspective, the hope lies in Januzakov, the country's leader of Kyrgyz origin, understanding the nuances of the issue more profoundly than his counterparts in the RevCom faction, primarily of Kazakh or Uzbek descent. As the debate unfolds, the Association of National Movements itself presses for policies granting ethnic communities more autonomy in land distribution. Prominent Tüde members opt for a compromise that seeks to address the concerns raised by the AMN while maintaining the overall stability achieved by the current system. This middle-ground approach aims to appeal to a broader spectrum of supporters and prevent internal factional rifts. They argue that the special commissions will deal with all land inequality issues separately on a local level. Those aligned with the Revolutionary Committee propose a radical approach focused on combating forehanded farmers, irrespective of their ethnic origin, and promoting voluntary collectivization."

Instead, he seized the moment to announce the birth of a new movement — 'Yosh Turkiston,' or 'Young Turkestan'. While embracing Pan-Turkism and emphasizing social unity and stability, Shokay sought to carve a distinct ideological space for his followers - truly an oppositional party, that is unwilling to work under socialist framework.

Two distinct approaches have emerged, each finding support within the factions of the ERK. Arguing for the adoption of Turki (Chagatai) language, the Tüde faction argues for reforms that accommodate regional variations, fostering linguistic diversity while maintaining a unified script. However, critics point out that this approach risks marginalizing the Farsi-speaking population of Tajiks.\n\nThe RevCom faction lends its support to a more inclusive vision, advocating for linguistic diversity reflective of Turkestan's multi-ethnic identity. This approach proposes the adoption of multiple official languages based on Chagatai — Kazakh, Uzbek, Karakalpak, Turkmen, and Kyrgyz. Additionally, Farsi is suggested as an official language to address the needs of the Tajik-speaking community. Proponents emphasize the importance of accommodating various linguistic communities to foster unity."

Building upon the previous decision to adopt Farsi and Chagatai as official languages alongside regional ones, the ERK now faces the monumental task of deciding on a standardized script. In the spirit of embracing Westernization and echoing the reforms of Mustafa Kemal, the leadership is contemplating the adoption of the Latin script. As the ERK consolidates its commitment to a diverse linguistic landscape with Farsi and Chagatai as key components, the proposal to shift to the Latin script gains prominence. This move is seen as a natural progression, aligning with the broader ethos of modernization while retaining the essence of linguistic diversity. Advocates argue that the Latin script will not only enhance communication but also symbolize Turkestan's integration with global progress."

This move, while seen as a departure from tradition, is presented as a practical step towards unifying the diverse linguistic communities under a common script.

As brothers-in-law, their relationship has been woven into the fabric of their lives, connecting them on a personal and profound level. Friendship between Toroqul and Turar began in the formative years of their childhood. Graduating together from the Merke Russian-Indigenous boarding school in 1909, they forged a friendship that transcended the confines of educational institutions. Their connection to Talas, a place they often visited as boys, further strengthened the foundation of their camaraderie.\n\nUnited by a shared vision of a better future for the people of Turkestan, Toroqul Januzakov and Turar Ryskulov embarked on a journey of active struggle in 1917. Their friendship, nurtured through years of shared experiences, became a cornerstone of their collaborative efforts to bring positive change to Turkestan.

The RevCom faction, ever watchful for opportunities to advance their agenda, seizes upon the situation to cast shadows of doubt over Ryskulov's suitability for the role.

Our government believes it to become a large sea port one day, moreover, located at the Central Asian Railway.\n\nThere is always a chance that the Kazakh government won't agree on any our term, but we will try to appease them as we can."

We should transfer the whole region of Zhetisu to them and in exchange we will guarantee independence of each other, sign military alliance and the [FROM.GetAdjective] government guarantees the representation of all Kazakh population.\n\nWhile this suggestion can seem ridiculuos at first, if we really want to unite our countries into a single state one day - this can be the first step towards it."

Moreover, they have suggested to hold the referendum themselves, which makes no sense. It seems that the [FROM.GetAdjective] government just does not want to recognize the results and are rudely interfering into people's will."

This is a small region with a small population and without any valuable resources. However, the town of Aralsk has a potential of becoming a large port in the future and a fishing site. In general, our government believes that it is a small price for friendship."

turkestan.50.t: "Evidence on Bukharan Support of Rebels"
turkestan.50.d: "We have exposed that the Emirate of Bukhara is sponsoring Mujahideen revolt in East Pamir by sending them ammunition and supplies. As the evidence unfolded, it painted a damning picture of Bukhara's interference in Turkestan's internal affairs. Ammunition and supplies flowed clandestinely from Bukhara to the Mujahideen, undermining stability and sowing discord within Turkestan. The question loomed: how should Turkestan respond to this breach of trust and violation of sovereignty?"
turkestan.50.a: "Condemn Bukhara's actions"
turkestan.50.b: "Show military strength along the border."
turkestan.50.c: "Subtly undermine Bukhara's interests in return"

turkestan.51.t: "Note of Protest From Turkestan!"

turkestan.52.t: "Turkestan's Show of Strength"
turkestan.52.d: "The city of Bukhara, bathed in the warm hues of sunset, stood as a silent witness to the brewing storm across its northern borders. The Emirate found itself thrust into a new era of uncertainty as Turkestan flexed its military muscle. The Emir, resplendent in his traditional attire, presided over an emergency council in the opulent chambers of the Ark Fortress. The air was thick with tension as advisors and military commanders weighed the gravity of Turkestan's actions. In the bustling bazaars of Bukhara, where traders had peddled wares for centuries, a palpable unease settled. The vibrant marketplaces, once alive with the cadence of commerce, now buzzed with hushed conversations and worried glances. Military strategists, their faces etched with concern, unfurled maps detailing the land between Bukhara and Turkestan. Contingency plans were devised, not only to counter potential aggression but also to navigate the complex web of alliances that could shape the emirate's destiny."
turkestan.52.a: "Damn."

turkestan.60.t: "1st Extraordinary Congress of the National Guard General Staff"
turkestan.60.d: "A biting chill swept through the high chambers of the National Guard General Staff headquarters, nestled in the heart of [Capital.GetName]. It was the 1st Extraordinary Congress, a gathering of strategic minds that marked a crucial moment in Turkestan's response to the East Pamir Revolt. The grand hall, adorned with maps and charts, was abuzz with anticipation. The agenda sprawled across the vast table like a topographic map. The primary focus was the Korşirmat's revolt, dissecting the challenges posed by the Mujahideen and formulating a response that would resonate through the peaks and valleys. Fortifying Fergana was a consensus, but the crux lay in deciding the approach—bold aggression or covert subversion.\n\nAs the congress unfolded, seasoned commanders, strategists, and advisors filled the hall. The scent of coffee and the rustle of maps being unfurled blended with the gravity of the discussions. The Mujahideen had entrenched themselves, forming an \"Islamic Government of Fergana", casting a menacing shadow over the once-peaceful region. The Turkestan government, facing a rising storm, convened a military congress to strategize its response. As the congress unfolded, voices echoed within the chamber, each articulating a different approach to quell the rebellion. General Ergash Bey, a seasoned military leader, head of the Mirshabs, stood before the gathered officials, maps spread across the table, tracing the contours of East Pamir. \"Our forts in Fergana are our first line of defense,\" he declared, his finger emphasizing critical points on the map. \"Reinforcing these bastions will send a clear message — we are resolute in maintaining order.\" The assembly listened, divided between those advocating a swift military offensive and others wary of the potential consequences. The discussion surged like a mountain river, tumultuous and unyielding. The room hushed as the choice presented itself like a fork in a treacherous mountain path. A daring proposal emerged to take the fight directly to the heights of the Mujahideen stronghold in the East Pamir Mountains: \"We scale their heights, catch them off guard, and reclaim control.\"\n\nA more covert approach suggested deploying specialized units to infiltrate the canyons and valleys of East Pamir: \"Strike from the shadows, disrupt their supply lines, and instill fear.\"
turkestan.60.a: "Launch a bold offensive in the mountains."
turkestan.60.b: "Guerilla tactics and ambush."

turkestan.61.t: "The Fateful Appeal"
turkestan.61.d: "Facing a mounting crisis in East Pamir, President Shokay's government in Turkestan reaches out to Russia, requesting military aid to quell the insurgency. The decision hangs in the balance, with potential consequences that could reshape the geopolitical landscape of the region. [Capital.GetName] is presented with a delicate choice. On one hand, intervening in Turkestan's internal conflict could stabilize the situation and prevent the region from descending further into chaos. This option, however, comes with significant risks—any perceived Russian interference might spark internal unrest within Turkestan, with accusations of puppetry and a loss of national autonomy. If we choose to assist Turkestan, our forces will be mobilized and deployed to East Pamir. The operation would be framed as a joint effort to maintain stability in the region, but can also stir discontent among Turkestan's population, leading to protests and accusations of compromising national sovereignty. We can always refrain from intervening, citing Turkestan's internal affairs. This choice will maintain the appearance of respecting Turkestan's sovereignty but risks the instability in East Pamir spiraling out of control. It also leaves Turkestan to handle the crisis alone, potentially straining the relationship between our nations."
turkestan.61.a: "Extend a 'helping' hand."
turkestan.61.b: "Further instability in Turkestan is a key to our success."

turkestan.62.t: "The Unwelcome Intervention"
turkestan.62.d: "In a surprising turn of events, President Shokay's government has reached out to Russia, seeking military assistance to quell the unrest in East Pamir, as promised in Tashkent Accords. The announcement has sparked controversy and accusations of puppetry. In the capital, [Capital.GetName], dissenting voices echo through the streets. Protesters gather, condemning what they perceive as a surrender of Turkestan's sovereignty to Russian interests. Opposition leaders decry Shokay as a puppet, accusing him of betraying the ideals of an independent Turkestan. Despite the domestic backlash, Russian military units swiftly deploy to East Pamir. The rugged terrain becomes a battleground as the well-equipped Russian forces engage the Mujahideen. A series of decisive actions sees the rebellion crushed, with the Mujahideen leader forced to flee, marking the end of the East Pamir crisis.\n\nAs the dust settles in East Pamir, concerns grow about the expanding influence of Russia in Turkestan. Critics argue that the military intervention not only quelled the rebellion but also paved the way for increased Russian involvement in Turkestan's internal affairs. The move raises questions about Shokay's commitment to true independence and fuels suspicions of a burgeoning pro-Russian puppet regime."
turkestan.62.a: "At least... we won."

turkestan.63.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused to Intervene!"
turkestan.63.d: "In the face of turmoil in East Pamir, Turkestan's plea for Russian intervention is met with a resounding refusal. In a terse response, Russia declares that the unrest in East Pamir is an internal matter for Turkestan to address. The decision is met with mixed reactions, as some see it as a respect for national sovereignty, while others interpret it as a reluctance to extend support. President Shokay, facing mounting pressure from both within and outside his government, addresses the nation. He acknowledges the Russian decision, expressing disappointment but emphasizing Turkestan's commitment to resolving its internal challenges independently. The rejection by Russia leaves Turkestan to grapple with the East Pamir crisis without external military support. The opposition seizes on this opportunity, intensifying their criticism of Shokay's leadership. Protests erupt across some regions of the country, demanding a more robust response to the insurgency."
turkestan.63.a: "Russia only 'helps' when not asked for it."

turkestan.64.t: "Bombardment of Osh"
turkestan.64.d: "The aerial bombardment of East Pamir leaves Turkestan's skies scarred, as the government's military strategy takes a devastating toll on the region. The aftermath paints a haunting picture of tragedy, dissent, and the shifting sands of public opinion. In a bid to quell the Mujahideen insurgency in East Pamir, the Turkestan government authorized a relentless aerial bombardment. The primary target was the southern part of Osh, believed to house the regional headquarters of the Korşirmat's 'Army of Islam'. Russian-built 'Tupolev' bombers soar through the clouds, unleashing a torrent of destruction upon the town. The calculated strikes, aimed at disrupting rebel operations and supply routes, result in widespread devastation. The central square of Osh, justified as a military target due to its strategic significance, becomes a grim battleground in the sky. The fallout was catastrophic, with reports confirming the loss of 209 lives in the bombing raid. The once-bustling streets of Osh now bear witness to the anguish of a grieving community. The tragedy resonates deeply, echoing through the narrow alleys and open squares that were once vibrant with life.\n\nNews of the aerial bombardment fans the flames of discontent within Turkestan. Citizens grapple with the moral implications of such a drastic military response. The widening rift between those who view it as a necessary evil for national security and those who condemn it as an indiscriminate act of violence becomes palpable. Even within the government, murmurs of criticism emerge. Some officials question the planning and precision of the strikes, fearing the collateral damage may breed resentment and fuel the insurgency further. As dissent simmers behind closed doors, the leadership grapples with the complexities of navigating a delicate balance between security and public sentiment."
turkestan.64.a: "Fire the officer who gave the order."

turkestan.65.t: "Victory in the Mountains"
turkestan.65.d: "The government forces, employing a combination of strategic planning, specialized forces, and aerial support, achieved significant victories in the East Pamir region. The town of Osh, a strategic gateway, fell to the advancing forces, disrupting the Mujahideen's connections to the broader Turkestan and Fergana Valley. The mountaineer efforts and the expertise of special forces played a crucial role in the success, allowing the government forces to navigate the challenging terrain and neutralize the insurgents. Aerial support, including precise bombings, contributed to the efficiency of the operations. In a decisive move, the last stronghold of the Mujahideen, the town of Murghab, was also liberated. The combined efforts on the ground and from the air led to the expulsion of the insurgents from this critical region. However, the leaders, including the influential figure Korşirmat, managed to evade capture, fleeing the region before the government forces could apprehend them. Their current whereabouts remain unknown, raising concerns about potential regrouping or seeking refuge in other countries. Despite this, the successful military operations mark a significant step toward stabilizing the East Pamir region."
turkestan.65.a: "Victory!"

turkestan.66.t: "Coup of the White Guard"
turkestan.66.d: "In the high mountainous terrain of the East Pamir, where the air thins and echoes carry for miles, discontent had been brewing for over 250 days. The government's feeble attempts to suppress the relentless insurgency had only fueled the flames of rebellion. Unbeknownst to the ruling elite, a hidden force was silently preparing to seize the reins of power. General-major Ivan Zaitsev, a seasoned officer with a reputation for cunning strategy, led the Turkestan Military Organisation (TVO). Hiding beneath the radar, the TVO had patiently gathered resources, won over sympathizers, and patiently awaited the opportune moment to strike. As the snow-capped peaks, flourishing valleys and cloistral glades stood witness to the unfolding drama, Zaitsev initiated a meticulously planned coup. The first whispers of discontent were sown among disillusioned military units, discontented civilians, and even sympathetic members of the ruling party. The cloak of secrecy that shrouded the TVO's operations only deepened the mystery surrounding their intentions.\n\nIn the dead of night, with a strategic precision that spoke of months of clandestine preparation, the TVO struck. Key industrial and transportation hubs fell under their control like pieces on a chessboard. The Fergana Valley, a prized jewel, was the next domino to fall, bringing the TVO closer to its ultimate goal. The support from unexpected quarters was one of the coup's most intriguing facets. Konstantin Monstrov, leader of the Fergana Peasant Army, found common cause with the TVO, supporting them instantly. Surprisingly, even among the Muslim population, there were those who saw the TVO as potential liberators from the shackles of an ineffective government.\n\nNews of the coup spread like wildfire. The elusive TVO, once hidden in the shadows, now emerged as the architects of Turkestan's destiny. Towns and cities, which had endured the relentless insurgency, were now subject to a shift in power dynamics. The Mujahideen forces, long ensconced in the insurgency zone, found themselves scattered and fleeing from an unpredictable fate. While some hailed the TVO as heroes, a beacon of hope in troubled times, others viewed them with trepidation. The specter of pro-Russian sentiments loomed large over the unfolding narrative. Whispers circulated that the TVO would usher in a regime that mirrored the dark days of colonial rule, wielding fear and terror as instruments of control."
turkestan.66.a: "Bravo, brothers!"

turkestan.67.t: "Coup of the Mirshabs"
turkestan.67.d: "Despite the government's attempts to quell the Mirshab insurgency, the streets of Turkestan continued to resonate with the rhythm of dissent. Ergash Bey, the enigmatic leader of the Mirshabs, orchestrated a symphony of defiance that proved too potent for the government to silence. Turkestan, already weathering internal divisions, found itself teetering on the precipice of chaos. In the turbulent shadows, Ergash Bey seized the moment with a calculated precision. Emboldened by the government's inability to suppress the Mirshab revolt, he orchestrated a coup d'état. In a swift and audacious move, Ergash Bey's forces, comprised of loyal Mirshabs and sympathizers, infiltrated key governmental institutions. The coup, with strategic maneuvers and political alliances forged in the crucible of rebellion, secured the support of Ittifoqi Muslimin. Ergash Bey, once the field commander of the Mirshabs, now ascended to the throne of leadership. The government, caught off guard and hampered by internal dissent, succumbed to the tidal wave of change. As the dust settled, Turkestan woke to a new reality — one shaped by the hand of Ergash Bey. The Mirshab leader, now at the helm, faced the daunting task of steering a fractured nation. The coup not only marked the failure of the government to control its own instruments of order but also heralded a new chapter under the leadership of its newfound helmsman."

turkestan.68.d.erk: "The sun ascended over Turkestan, casting its glow on a nation long ensnared by internal strife. In the heart of Tashkent a groundswell of democratic fervor unfolded, signaling the triumph of Milliy Ittihod against the ERK government. The city echoed with a chorus of citizens from all walks of life, marching together in peaceful demonstrations. Streets bore witness to a collective call for democratic governance and an end to the protracted crisis, as the government asserted control over key institutions, dismantling the remnants of the ERK administration. In a surprising turn, ERK leaders engaged in negotiations with Milliy Ittihod representatives. Recognizing the imperative for stability and inclusivity, a transition plan emerged through skillful diplomacy. The red and blue flags were finally restored over the administrative buildings in Tashkent, marking restoration of stability."
turkestan.68.d: "Amidst the rugged grandeur of East Pamir, a different saga unfolded — one of resilience and military prowess. Milliy Ittihod's forces embarked on a challenging campaign against the entrenched Mujahideen government. The craggy mountains bore witness to the perseverance of Turkestan forces, who pressed forward despite the formidable terrain. In the midst of this military endeavor, Milliy Ittihod engaged in intricate diplomatic overtures with local leaders and influential figures in East Pamir. Recognizing the region's diverse ethnic and tribal dynamics, alliances were forged, eroding the Mujahideen's grip on power. As Turkestan's red and blue flags fluttered over the liberated expanse of East Pamir, the victory was not just military but a testament to the art of negotiation. Even the highest peaks of the Pamir now witnessed the democratic dawn in Turkestan."

turkestan.72.d: "As whispers of resistance grew louder in the Russian settlements, Konstantin Monstrov, the charismatic head of the Fergana Peasant Army, emerged from the shadows. His influence over the disgruntled Russian settlers reached its peak, culminating in a coup. The government's attempts to navigate the delicate balance between the interests of various ethnic groups unraveled in the face of the resolute opposition from the Russian settlers. Their protests, initially confined to the streets, evolved into a coordinated rebellion led by Monstrov. The Fergana Peasant Army, now a rallying point for those opposed to the government's policies, swelled in numbers. Monstrov, a shrewd tactician, orchestrated a series of strategic moves that paralyzed the government. With each passing day, the grip of the authorities weakened, and the once-stable Turkestan plunged into uncertainty. As the Russian settlers rallied behind the banner of the Fergana Peasant Army, their discontent fused with a broader sentiment of disillusionment with the government. The coup, executed with precision and popular support, saw Monstrov ascend to a position of power. The government, grappling with internal strife and external pressures, failed to quell the uprising. The unintended consequences of the repatriation policy had not only fractured the nation but had now placed it in the hands of a leader who sought to reshape its destiny."

turkestan.100.t: "Tensions Grow"
turkestan.100.d: "As in many other cities of the former Russian Empire, the Russian population constituted a significant part of them. Turkestan was no exception, where our largest city and industrial center, Tashkent, has a significant Russian population. It is noteworthy that it was in Tashkent that the great Russian-chauvinist Turkestan Soviet Republic was formed, and it was from Tashkent that the last Russian troops were withdrawn. \n\nIn addition to the large cities, however, Russian settlers also made up a significant peasant population. It was they who formed the backbone of the Monstrov Peasant Army 20 years ago, and now they continue to live peacefully under the warm Turkestan sun.\n\nHowever, it's not all that simple. Recently, incidents of harassment of the Muslim population by the Russian-speaking population have become more frequent. According to the minister-chairman, all these clashes between non-Muslims and Muslims are initiated by Shuro-Ulema in order to unleash ethnic conflicts.

### Ideas ###
TRK_lasting_political_crisis: "Divided Governance"
TRK_lasting_political_crisis_desc: "For nearly two decades now, the Turkestan is ruled separately by two governments: the Federal Government, a coalition between the Jadidists and Qadimists in a weak balance under the leadership of Mustafa Shokay, and the Provisional Fergana Government, under the leadership of Madamin-Bey. While the Madamin-Bey's government has no real authority over the majority of Turkestan's territory, he's supported by some more radical groups, such as Korşirmat's Mujahideen and Monstrov's Peasant Army. The outcome of this confrontation will shape Turkestan's future."
TRK_illusion_of_democracy: "Incipient Democracy"
TRK_illusion_of_democracy_desc: "The notion of Turkestan as a democratic republic is a mere facade. While elections are conducted, parties exist nominally, and organizations operate without stringent regulations, the true power lies firmly with Minister-President Shokay and a faltering Jadidist-Qadimist coalition."
TRK_paramilitary_activities: "Unbridled Paramilitaries"
TRK_paramilitary_activities_desc: "Turkestan's turbulent political landscape is further complicated by active paramilitary groups — the Turkestan Military Organisation, a clandestine Russophilic faction; ERK's Turkestan Legion, a socialist Pan-Turkist militia; and the Mujahideen of Korşirmat, entrenched in the East Pamir mountains. With the Turkestan National Guard's limited control, these radical movements pose a significant threat, capable of seizing power or exacerbating chaos."
TRK_army_of_mishrabs: "Vigilance of Mirshabs"
TRK_army_of_mishrabs_desc: "The Mirshabs, local militia and police units, emerge as the de facto armed forces of Turkestan due to the internal factionalism. Under the leadership of Ergash Bey, they profess allegiance to both the people and the state, as long as the state upholds the tenets of the Muslim faith."
TRK_civil_war: "Civil War"

TRK_east_pamir_revolt: "East Pamir Revolt"
TRK_east_pamir_revolt_desc: "The Mujahideen in the East Pamir mountains, probably sponsored by Bukhara’s Kashbegi, Ibrahim-Bey, are currently rebelling against our democratic rule. We need to get rid of the insurgency before the elections, unless we want some trouble."

#Why did the "ERK" party openly adopt a socialist program? The main reason for the alienation of the native working class from national organizations and rapprochement with local and Russian workers and organizations was that such figures as Mustafa Shokay in 1917 in Kokand in a sharp form opposed socialism. Jadidists did not want to get closer to workers' unions and opposed the idea that apartments for middle-income workers and employees should be built by the state. It was at that time that the idea of forming the Tüde workers' party emerged, which was aimed at separating the Muslim workers from the Russian socialist parties and trade unions. ERK envisioned socialism as a democratic federation uniting national-state formations on the scale of Russia, which emerged on the basis of taking into account the uniqueness of each nation. ERK was against dictatorial tyranny. And the Russian Communist Party on the scale of all Russia pursued a policy of imperialist socialism. At that time, the Central Committee of the RCP allowed the establishment of a "Muslim Center" in Moscow, intended to help the Bolsheviks in their propaganda among Muslims, but did not allow the establishment of branches of this center locally. In 1920 ERK drew up the program of the party, adapting it to the conditions of Russia, and after emigration ERK did not find it necessary to change it. ERK party will be able to gain authority among the people if it stays true to the national idea and Islam. Only the party has to learn to operate in the conditions of democratic freedoms. In many cases we use the word "Muslim" or "Turkestan" instead of the word "Turk" to save the feelings of Tajiks. That is, racism is alien to us. If socialist theory, taking democracy and evolutionary development as its basis, can be combined with the national idea and Islamic values, it will be able to influence the broad masses in Turkestan. ERK  is a party peculiar only to Turkestan. Its program and ideas are not suitable for dissemination and use in other countries. The deprivation of the right of the peoples to be masters of their own wealth will lead to the establishment of unlimited domination over the individual. The essence is this: ERK must not be deceived by the imperialist, dictatorial socialism of the great powers and will strive for a socialism that does not restrict the rights of nations and the free will of individuals, but protects the autonomy of peoples and remains faithful to democratic norms.
