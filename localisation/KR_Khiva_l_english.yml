It was planned to distribute to the people all the property belonging to Khiva khans, toras and beks, to distribute lands of the rich to the poor, to open free hospitals and schools, to build roads and bridges, political freedom, national equality, to overthrow the khanate system and establish democratic popular power - a republic.

### Events ###
khiva.1.t:0 "The Recent History of Khwarezm"
khiva.1.d:0 "The Khanate of Khiva had been under Russian protectorate since 1873. However, after the February Revolution of 1917 in Russia, the Young Khivans presented the Khiva khan Isfandiyar-khan with demands for reforms, with which he was forced to agree and promised to establish a majlis and limit his own power. However, the situation further escalated and the Young Khiva government was overthrown and the planned liberal reforms were not carried out.\n\nIn January 1918, Isfandiyar-khan appointed Junaid-khan as commander of the armed forces of the khanate, but after the Russian detachment left Khiva, by order of Junaid-khan Isfandiyar-khan was killed. Junaid-khan made Said Abdullah-khan, Isfandiyar's younger brother, the puppet monarch, and he himself became the sole ruler of Khiva.\n\nThe Mujahideen were well armed, the Khiva territories were flourishing, and Junaid-Khan kept an iron grip on his army, sending it east and north to attack the Reds, where he became famous for his victories in several hard battles.\n\nWhen the dust settled over Central Asia and the war ended, the Russians soon discovered that it was much more difficult to negotiate with Junaid-Khan than with Isfandiar. Although Russia now recognized Khiva's sovereignty, the Sazonov government still sought to keep Khiva within its sphere of influence and to maintain access to its vast natural resources. Junaid-Khan was vehemently opposed to this, as well as to many of the political reforms in the khanate previously supported by the Russian republicans. The brigand tsar was ready to send his invincible army against the weakened Russians and chase them away if they exceeded their authority."
khiva.1.a:0 "Interesting"

khiva.2.t:0 "Junaid-Khan Is Dead!"
khiva.2.d:0 "Junaid-Khan, proud Yomud military commander and our “dear” leader for almost 20 years has finally succumbed to the withering of age and has passed away. The Khanate mourns as they prepare for the coming power struggle."
khiva.2.a:0 "Eshi-Khan, son of Junaid-Khan, ascends the throne"
khiva.2.b:0 "A Turkmen chief, Azis-Khan, seizes power."

khiva.3.t:0 "The Rule of Junaid-Khan"
khiva.3.d:0 "Throughout the 1920s the Russians tried to persuade Junaid-Khan to demobilize his army and sign a treaty of friendship with Russia, but all these talks collapsed after Kolchak's coup. He announced the end of the old era of obedience and his intention to immediately restore the territories that Khiva had lost after it had been subdued five decades before, and the Russians were virtually powerless to stop him as his Basmachi army had annexed the entire Transcaspian region with large Turkmen population.\n\nIn time Russia was forced to accept the new terms of cooperation with Khiva, and efforts were made to normalize both political and commercial relations with the new khanate, although Junaid was still much more protective of his economy than previous rulers.\nThe decade that followed was a difficult period for Junaid-Khan, as he owned a vast country, but he had to face the difficulties of actually governing the state. He faced problems in the form of liberal movements, and Uzbeks displeased with the Turkmen ruler. Eventually Junaid decided to retain a few barbaric elements of Basmachi just to maintain stability. Loyal cronies were promoted to replace capable administrators, and the brigands were given the right to collect taxes and tribute. That made Khiva to remain an agrarian, nomadic country in the middle of the desert.\n\nAlthough Khiva's impressive agriculture kept the country afloat, the situation seemed to be on a downward spiral, as there was little to keep the people united. To solve this problem, Junaid began cultivating a sense of Turkmen nationalism influenced by the ideas of his more intellectual ally Aziz Khan, in the hope that a common collective identity would bind the Turkmen tribes together. The aging Junaid-khan also began to prepare his son Eshey-khan, a capable warrior, to inherit the throne after his imminent death. But Junaid is adamant: he must first destroy the remaining organized political opposition and stabilize the country to ensure a smooth transition of power to his son."

khiva.4.t:0 "Breadbasket of Turkestan"
khiva.4.d:0 "The oasis located on the Amu Darya together with the developed irrigation system allowed Khiva to become the breadbasket of Turkestan - to have a huge income from the export of agricultural products. Another source was minerals mined near the Aral Sea. Despite the increasing protectionism of Junaid-Khan, Khiva goods were in great demand in Russia, which brought in most of the export revenues every year.\n\nHowever. that was all. To the south lay the barren Karakum Desert, and near the border with Persia lay the abandoned Trans-Caspian Railway, which connected a port on the Caspian Sea with the rest of Turkestan. In addition to the riches that the land brings, another important source of income is the smuggling of weapons and the robbery of caravans, which have recently been very reluctant to visit Khwarezm."

khiva.5.d:0 "As the economic crisis broke out in Europe and everywhere else in the world, it also affected our most important importers - Russia and Kokand.

In the absence of Junaid-Khan and his associates in the capital of Khorezm, the opposition moved to the other side of the Amu-Darya from Turtkul and seized power in the city, announcing the establishment of the Provisional Council of the Khiva Khanate. \n\nThe council included both former cronies of the murdered Isfandiyar Khan and the Young Khivans. The power of this council is not yet strong, but it seems that the Dictator of Khwarezm must urgently return to the capital and suppress this palace coup."

He urged the citizens to rally around him as a true representative of all the peoples of the Khanate, not just a small group of Uzbeks at the mouth of the Amu Darya.\n\nHowever, in Khiva itself, with its predominantly Uzbek population, Junaid-khan met fierce resistance. Many of the palace and city guards defected to the conspirators, as did the population, who were clearly in favor of the Young Khiva's reforms.\n\nThe situation was uncertain and with roughly equal numbers of opposing forces, the outcome of the battle for Khiva remains unknown..."

Junaid Khan's troops were pushed beyond the original Khiva and dispersed across the Karakum desert. Rumors reached us that Junaid-Khan himself was settling in Ashgabat, gathering another army to fight us.\n\nBut even now, with our small forces, we have been able to rally the people and establish control over the northern part of the Khanate. \n\nThe Provisional Council announced reforms, the adoption of a constitution and limiting the role of the monarch."

khiva.11.t:0 "Khiva Massacre"
khiva.11.d:0 "The last few days will go down in history as terrible days for the Khanate of Khiva. More terrible than the Soviet attack and the coup of 1918. \n\nThe streets of the ancient city were sprinkled with the blood of the rebels and protesters, as well as all those who in any way tried to hold the defense in the city. Many were killed, but the disgraceful leadership of the opposition, the vile conspirators, were able to move back to the lands of Kokand. \n\nThe Dictator of Khwarezm has regained power and order will now be restored with an even harsher hand."

From the interrogation, we found out who the customer was, and it turned out to be the Khivan Khan's vizier, Junaid-Khan, the Dictator of Khwarezm. With the gun-runners exposed, our government has put them on trial, also launching a large-scale investigation into leaks in weapons depots, and has also expressed a diplomatic protest to Khiva, restricting all trade with them."

khiva.21.d:0 "The 1936 has just began only to inform the closest confederates of Junaid-Khan about his illness. The 79-year old Yomud, Dictator of Khwarezm, who has been in power for 18 years, has not only become too paranoid and physically ill, but, perhaps... mentally ill, as well.\n\nThe Jadidist movement of Young Khivans, who has for long been a cause for all Khan's crackdowns on freedom, has gained some strength over the years, especially after the neighboring Kokand Republic gained some stability and strength.\n\nMoreover, some of the Turkmen tribes in the south became too unruly, blocking the trade ways from Persia and Afghanistan, raiding on the caravans and preventing gold, goods and weapons from reaching the Junaid-Khan's treasury. It's time to deal with all these problems, while the dictator is still alive."

khiva.22.d:0 "The Southern Turkmen tribes have been rebelling against our rule since 1935, when Junaid-Khan has demanded more tribute from them, due to the economic isolation of the Khanate. When they refused, he ordered to incinerate fertile fields and burn villages to the ground. This criminal order was successfully carried out by his henchmen, depriving the khanate of some of the harvest, and some Turkmen tribes of families, shelter and food.\n\nThe Turkmen tribes should be pacified now, and the old Dictator suggested that he should visit their elders himself and make them respect him. While some of his henchmen believe this to be generally a bad idea, no one dares to dissuade Junaid-Khan, fearing for his head."

khiva.35.d:0 "With the opposition gaining a foothold in the Khivan oasis and keeping large amount of resources under their control, it is time to settle the most vital issues.\n\nThe most important one - is the question of power. The opposition, consisting of both Young Khivans and former loyalists of murdered Isfandiyar-khan are experiencing great difficulties in cooperating. Ishahoja Hojaev, appointed as the Vizier of the Supervisory Council, or Nozirlar Kengashi, is a staunch Kadimist and reactionary. He's not really a supporter of constitutional monarchy, Young Khivans have been promoted all these years. But he actually has no choice at all. With Sayid Abdullah-khan being a titular monarch all these years, in fact, under house arrest, he's known to be a weak and naive person. Whether these differences between coalition partners will be eventually resolved is an open question, though."
khiva.35.a:0 "Let us hope Khiva will remain stable."

khiva.36.t:0 "Usul-i-Jadid"
khiva.36.d:0 "The Junaid-Khan regime practically did not deal with the modernization of education or education in general. Young Khivans advocated the introduction of a new method in mektebs and madrasahs - the sound method of literacy teaching to replace the alphabetic one. The obsolete religious schools of Khorezm had to be replaced by national secular schools and science and culture had to be developed.\n\nThe plans of the Young Khiva include the establishment of a solid academic year with examinations and a transition to a class-lesson system of teaching. In addition, the new-method schools should introduce standard European ways of teaching: desks, gradebooks, benches, blackboards, division of students into classes, and class time into lessons. Other secular disciplines should also be greatly expanded. Schools should teach history (tarihi), geography, and arithmetic in addition to religion.\n\nAll this has long existed in the schools of Russia and Turkestan, and Khorezm has lagged far behind not only the modernized Western powers, but even its neighbors. The Vizier is expected to pass this bill, otherwise Khiva will remain backward."
khiva.36.a:0 "Our people in a desperate need of modern education."

khiva.37.t:0 "Writing the Constitution"
khiva.37.d:0 "The Nozirlar Kengashi finally sat down to write Khorezm's supreme legal document - the first time in its centuries-long history a constitution was planned - and to limit the monarch's power on paper. And for centuries to come. Fortunately, Sayid Abdullah Khan is a weak and unambitious man, who will not be able to prevent it in any way, like the Emir of Bukhara. \n\nThe main difficulty at this stage will be to negotiate the constitution with the more conservative coalition partners and the Vizier, who may react negatively to the radical modernist reforms of Young Khiva."
khiva.37.a:0 "Let the Council see sense."

khiva.38.t:0 "Council Splits on Property Question"
khiva.38.d:0 "On the issue of property, the Council could not reach a consensus. The most radical Jadidists, as well as members of the Communist Party of Khorezm, considered it necessary and important to nationalize the property and all resources of the Khanate, as well as to expropriate Khan's property.\n\nDespite years of stealing from the inhabitants of Khorezm and the enormous accumulation of treasury wealth, some of which Junaid-Khan was able to export, the conservative Nazirs opposed such radical measures."
khiva.38.a:0 "We will decide this question by a separate decree later."

khiva.39.t:0 "Limitation of Khan"
khiva.39.d:0 "One of the main articles of the constitution should be the legal establishment of a limited monarchy. On this question, a sudden discussion first broke out, and the radical Young Khivans and Communists proposed to abolish the monarchy in general and establish a republican system. However, all in all, citing the incompetence of Said Abdullah Khan, the Council was able to agree on the most important reform - the adoption of a constitutional monarchy."
khiva.39.a:0 "Agreed."

khiva.40.t:0 "The Parliament"
khiva.40.d:0 "Another important issue in the discussion of the constitution was the institution of Parliament. In accordance with the 1917 draft reforms, the Young Khiva proposed the creation of a bicameral parliament, the Majlis. The upper chamber should be the Nozirlar Kengashi itself, and the government should be formed after the elections. \n\nHowever, this was sharply opposed by conservative lawmakers, who argued that it would be much more effective to create a unicameral parliament and strengthen the power of the government. Such a project would prevent effective representation of all ethnic groups living in Khorezm, including the majority Turkmen and a minority of Uzbeks and Karakalpaks."
khiva.40.a:0 "A bicamerial structure is appreciated."
khiva.40.b:0 "One-chambered parliament with strong government."

khiva.41.t:0 "Administrative Division"
khiva.41.d:0 "The issue of administrative division was also hotly debated. The proposal of the leftist ministers was to introduce special autonomous Vyaylets for the Turkmen and Karakalpaks, but the conservatives opposed any singling out of special autonomies, arguing that this would destroy the great Khorezm state, which should be centralized and united. "
khiva.41.a:0 "Divide the Khanate into equal Vilayats"

Tomorrow morning the text of the new Constitution will be in all the newspapers of the country, and now it is time to hold the first elections to the Majlis and form a legitimate government. Of course, if the Vizier doesn't interfere in any way..."
khiva.42.a:0 "A great success for our country!"

khiva.43.t:0 "The New-Method Schools Rejected by Vizier"
khiva.43.d:0 "Unfortunately, the project proposed by the Young Khivans to introduce new-methodical schools in Khorezm failed... The Vizier, Ishahoja Hojaev, suppressed the bill by refusing to sign it. It seems that the confrontation between Jadidists and Kadimists will only intensify after this unlawful ban. \n\nAlready now Young Khiva understands that the Vizier is becoming an insurmountable obstacle on the way to democratization and modenization of Khorezm, while the Vizier himself is already openly criticizing the reformers."
khiva.43.a:0 "Another obstacle on our path to modernization!"

khiva.44.t:0 "An Important Bill Rejected by the Council"
khiva.44.d:0 "Today, a bill proposed by the radical part of Young Khiva, together with the Communists, to control the state treasury was rejected in the Council. Conservatives criticized the draft for its radical nature and declared that the state treasury should not be subjected to any changes, and in general it was better not to be touched by anyone except the Treasurer, Khan, and Vizier."
khiva.44.a:0 "Nazirs become a real hindrance to us!"

khiva.45.t:0 "Tensions Grow in Nozirlar Kengashi"
khiva.45.d:0 "A number of radical bills have recently been rejected by conservative ministers or rejected by the Vizier, and with this there is growing overt tension between conservatives and reformers.\n\nThe Young Khivans are becoming really disenchanted with the ideas of constitutional monarchy and are very concerned about the Kadimist sentiments in society. The failure to hold elections, which have long been on the horizon, also adds to the tension."
khiva.45.a:0 "At least the country is stabilizing"

khiva.46.t:0 "Flaws in the Constitutional System"
khiva.46.d:0 "The system adopted by the Nozirlar Kengashi proved to be completely unsuitable. In particular, the reformers did not foresee that the appointment of elections takes place with the approval of the Vizier, who had already been postponing them for several months. Moreover, the Vizier has no right to cancel them, but can only postpone them. This parade of postponements has been going on for quite some time.\n\nIn this connection, at a joint meeting of the parties of Young Khiva and Communists, the procedure for the next postponement of the elections was agreed upon. The radicals proposed a radical option - the overthrow of the monarchy and the Vizier and the long-awaited liberation of Khorezm from authoritarianism and nepotism. On the other hand, the more moderate Young Khiva believe that the monarchy itself does not pose any threat, and the problem is only in the conservatives, who actually hold power by force, because their public support is obviously much less than that of the Young Khiva."
khiva.46.a:0 "Elections are once again postponed"

khiva.47.t:0 "Political Crisis Gains Momentum"
khiva.47.d:0 "The protracted political crisis brewing on the sidelines of the Majlis seems about to peak. Recently, the revolution's only success has been the adoption of a constitution - and it has not been fully respected. The tension between reformers and conservatives is already so great that the Young Khiva ignores the Council's meetings in their entirety, depriving it of a quorum. \n\nBekjon Rakhmon, one of the leftist leaders of Young Khiva, for the first time made an open demand to the Nozirlar Kengashi - to resign all the reactionaries preventing modernization, including the Vizier."
khiva.47.a:0 "The reactionaries should resign!"

khiva.48.t:0 "Young Khivans Disappointment Grows"
khiva.48.d:0 "With the conservatives unwilling to contribute in any way to modernization, the Communists and Young Khiva gathered for an emergency council to organize a revolution. There was no turning back, and the realization of the need for a Second Revolution had already reached all members of both parties.\n\nHowever, the Council has not yet agreed on how power will be arranged after the successful overthrow of the conservatives. The Communists undoubtedly insist on the overthrow of the monarchy as a whole and a transition to a socialist democratic system, but such an approach is not echoed by some Young Khivaites, including their spiritual and political leader Boboohun Salimov. In the event that the Revolution decides to leave the monarch in power, it is quite possible that the Communists will abandon us. However, we may not fear them, as their popularity is extremely low."

The Vizier listened to him and hopefully, he understood all the importance of the modernization. However, his final decision is yet to be announced."

At the same time, prices proved to be too high and rose almost exponentially. On the other hand, no one can afford to buy these goods, much less our foreign importers.\n\nThe situation is clearly out of control, and urgent measures must be taken - namely, the establishment of a monopoly on prices by the state.

Decades ago, during the Soviet Intervention, he had already left the Young Khivans and was one of the founding members of the Khorezm Communist Party, that seized to exist as soon as Bolsheviks were driven out of Turkestan. Now, the legacy of the Communist party, seems to live on with Polvonniyoz announcing XSP. This time their policies were based more on SR program, that is by a large extent a peasant-oriented problem, than the Bolsheviks had."
khiva.61.a:0 "We welcome Khivan socialists!"

khiva.62.t:0 "Abolition of Young Khiva"
khiva.62.d:0 "Since the establishment of the XSP and larging tendencies of authoritarianism during Atabayev's rule, the Young Khiva party eventually disbanded itself, with their former members either joining XSP or YHP. Now, there are only two parties left in the region, with XSP far more popular in the Uzbek-majority regions, while YHP gets landslide victories in the majority of districts, where the Turkmens live."
khiva.62.a:0 "Glad they realized all advantages of socialism!"

khiva.63.t:0 "Turkmen Identity Effort"
khiva.63.d:0 "The Turkmens are in majority Nomadic tribes, that wandered the Karakum desert for several centuries without ever settling down. With the modernization and urbanization coming to Transcaspian Region with the Russian colonization, the Turkmens were oppressed - firstly under the Khivan Khans of Uzbek origin and later by Russian colonizers. Now, the Turkmens are finally free. With the decision to transform Khorezm into a Turkmen state, Atabayev now faces several issues considering the Turkmen identity.\n\nFirst of all, he can base the Turkmen identity on heroic deeds of the past, like Seljuk and Khwarazmian Empires. But this will probably make our regime more nationalist. On the other hand, we can connect identity to our traditions of nomadic life and collectivism. Finally, we can focus on being always oppressed by large Empires, like Khivan and Russian ones and base our indentity on being anti-colonialist and anti-Imperialist."

khiva.64.d:0 "With the YHP's successful policies in Turkmenistan, more and more dehkans and Turkmens are becoming aware of their identity and start to act as citizens. With this in mind, Atabayev issued establishment of numerous local councils all around the country with locals being elected. A true local self-government is being developed, but YHP decided to take the next step. With special decree of the government, the Majlis is to be transformed into Halk Maslahaty (People's Council). It should be now formed through a multi-level council system, similar to those of Russian narodniks.\n\nWith elections to the new Parliament held soon after the change, the new composition of the Halk Maslahaty has gathered in order to held a Congress. The absolute majority of the mandates were given to the deputies from YHP with a small number of non-partisans and candidates from XSP and former Young Khivans\n\nThe Congress re-appointed Atabayev as the Premier of Turkmenistan and adopted a new program of national development.\nThis opens a bright new page of Turkmen history."

khiva.65.d:0 "With our new identity efforts, the Turkmen nationalism has been recently on rise.

On one hand, the Titular Khan, as the descendant of Gengis Khan gave enough stability and legitimacy to the Junaid-Khan's regime. But since the latest events, his value as a figurehead has drastically changed. Sayid Abdullah-khan is now nothing more than a weak and probably sick man, under house arrest in the palace, taking up some place. His life is rather pointless now.\n\nThere are several choices what we can do with the Khan now. The first is to exile him and proclaim a republic. Moreover, build a new republic with strong Turkmen national identity. But this plan has some disadvantages, as the foreign countries can use Sayid Abdullah-khan same as we did. The second plan is rather brutal - to end the pathetic life of his, depriving others of the opportunity to use Khan as an excuse for their aggression. By doing so, we will consolidate our power and can either establish a Turkmen republic, or proclaim a new Dynasty of Junaid-Khan and his descendants."

But it was rather hard to believe in it, since the man was in pretty common clothes and the Khivan Khan was heard to never appear in public for the last 5 years. It would have been totally a nonsensical story, if not the news from Khwarezm earlier this week. According to them, Junaid-Khan, the Vizier and Dictator, has abandoned monarchy and proclaimed himself the only head of state.\n\nThe border guards telegraphed to the [ROOT.Capital.GetName] in order to know what to do with a man, who claimed to be the Khan of Khiva. After some hours, he was taken to the capital, where he was recognized as a legitimate Khivan Khan. Only after that this information was reported to [ROOT.GetLeader] who had to decide what to do with the exiled monarch. On one hand, this can be a trap. But on the other hand, we can finally get a legitimate wargoal and destroy the Turkmen Usurper in Khiva."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_JUNAID_KHAN_DESC:0 "Junaid-khan, chief of the Yomud tribe, dictator of Khwarezm, was born in the village of Bedirkent of Tagtin etrap in 1862 under the name of Gurbanmammet Serdar. For some time he was a judge and peacemaker in his village until the Turkmens, who suffered humiliation because of the tsarist government's colonial policy, were forced to take up arms. Junaid-khan first gathered a group of well-armed relatives around him and earned the title of Sardar. He then subjugated a number of nobles and generals and even killed his own cousin for the sake of justice. With such actions he traveled all over the country. He came to be called Junaid-Khan because he was able to protect the honor and rights of his villagers, whether they were poor or rich.\n\nJunaid soon became a well-known and popular warlord, leader of the united Turkmen tribes, who resisted Russian and Khivan oppression. In 1913, his armed detachment reached 15 thousand men. Some foreign governments were also well aware that Junaid-Khan would be a great help in squeezing Tsarist Russia out of Turkestan. Therefore, beginning in 1914, Junaid-khan's activities were supported first by German-Turkish, and then by British intelligence. In 1916 a new rebellion bursted out in Khiva, but was suppressed and Junaid-khan went to Afghanistan, from where he returned in September 1917.\n\nDuring this time, the situation had changed dramatically. The wave of revolution in Russia reached Khiva. In September 1917, after the overthrow of the Young Khiva government, which advocated reforms and limitation of khan's power, Junaid-khan returned. Having united the previously warring Turkmen tribes, he became one of the most influential people in the Khanate.\n\nIn January 1918 Isfandiyar-khan appointed Junaid-khan commander of the armed forces of the khanate, giving him the title "Serdar-Karim". After Russian detachment left Khiva for Turkestan, Junaid-khan's detachment of about 1600 horsemen became the main military force of the Khanate. In March 1918, Eshi-khan, son of Junaid-khan, by order of his father organized the murder of Isfandiyar-khan in his palace Nurullaboy, and the murdered brother, Sayid Abdullah, was enthroned. Junaid-Khan effectively became the sole ruler of the khanate, ignoring the nominally ruling monarch.\n\nThe following decade was a difficult period for Junaid-khan, as he owned a large country, but had to contend with the difficulties of actually governing the state. He faced problems in the form of liberal movements and disgruntled Uzbeks. Eventually Junaid decided to keep a few barbaric elements of the Mujahideen just to maintain stability. The aging Junaid-Khan also began to prepare his son Yeshi Khan, a capable warrior, to inherit the throne after his approaching demise."
POLITICS_BOBOOKHUN_DESC:0 "Boboohun was born in 1874 in the family of Salimohun in the village of Gurlen. At birth, he was named Muhammad, but later, out of respect, he was nicknamed Boboohun. After receiving his primary education, he continued his education at the madrasa of Allakuli Khan in Khiva. He studied Arabic, Persian and Russian.\n\nFrom 1910 to 1918, during the reign of Khan Isfandiyar Khan of Khiva, Boboohun Salimov held the post of kazi-kalyan (supreme judge) and Sheikh-ul-Islam of the country. \n\nIn 1917, he became chairman of the Khiva Mejlis, but soon his reformist government was overthrown and he was forced to hide in Turtkul, on the territory of Kokand. He became a member of the Young Khiva party, and soon the leader of this movement. Being a supporter of the democratic development of Khorezm, Boboohun became the main symbol of the struggle of the peoples of Khiva for freedom and the main opponent of the dictatorial regime of Junaid Khan"
POLITICS_SAYID_ABDULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Sayid Abdullah-khan is the Khan of Khiva of the Qungrat dynasty, from 1 October 1918. After the previous Khan, Isfandiyar-khan, brother of Sayid Abdullah-khan, was murdered during Junaid-Khan's coup, he was enthroned in his place. However, he had no real power and served as a source of legitimacy for the Junaid-Khan's rule. For many years he was almost under house arrest in the palace of Nurullaboy, forced to participate in public events. He's known to for his naivety and overall weakness. Sayid never was taught how to be a real monarch and should the opposition seize power, he can at most become another Titular Khan in the hands of more ambitious and powerful people."
POLITICS_GAYGYSYZ_ATABAYEV_DESC:0 "Gaygysyz Atabayev was born to a family of a wealthy miller and daughter of an Afghan vizier, but he early became an orphan. He was lucky to get an education in Tashkent Teacher's Seminary, which brought him up to become an enlightened citizen. In 1918 he became a member of the Russian Left SR Party, being enchanted with their ideas of social equality and national representation. Soon he became one of the leading indigineous socialists in Transcaspian region. However, at first the Left SR Uprising was suppressed in Russia, and than all socialist forces in Turkestan were eliminated. The Transcaspian region once became part of Russia"

UZB_moribund_governance_desc:0 "After the February Revolution, Isfandiyar Khan, under pressure from the Young Khivans, was forced to carry out major reforms, establishing, among others, the Khiva legislative assembly, the ministry of finance, and large-scale infrastructure projects. After Junaid-khan overthrew and assassinated Isfandiyar, these projects were suspended and then cancelled as Junaid sought to eliminate any influence of the Young Khiva in his government. While this was a good way to strengthen Junaid's personal influence, it left our government unstaffed and ineffective, unable to solve many of the same problems that people had two decades earlier."
UZB_khan_army:0 "Junaid-Khan's Host"
UZB_khan_army_desc:0 "For centuries the army of the khanate was divided into a peasant militia, a standing royal army serving as palace guards, and a large network of rural tribes who swore allegiance to the khan as vassals. Junaid-Khan achieved prominence by winning the loyalty of this third faction by persuading them to swear allegiance to him in the first place. Unfortunately, the complicated political nature of our army, the lack of discipline, and Junaid-Khan's dependence on the appeasement of his tribesmen greatly hindered our ability to modernize the army. "

UZB_many_sons_of_oghuz_desc:0 "The various Turkmen tribes from the Khwarezm oasis to the Caspian Sea and Aral Sea have never before considered themselves a single people. Even now, the unity of the Khiva Turkmens lies in a common purpose, not in a common culture, language, or geographic location. Junaid-Khan became a hero among them when he united many disparate tribes and led his brave warriors to victory over the Bolsheviks. This great victory and his coronation as Khan of Khiva was enough to begin building the unified Turkmen identity that Khan carefully cultivated over the years, but most of our Turkmens still identify themselves primarily with their tribal groups, and conflicts between these numerous tribes remain woefully high.\n\nEven Despite Junaid-Khan's authority among the tribes, southern Turkmen tribes are challenging his power in the region, probably supported by either Persians or Ottomans. We must try to put them in place and show who is the real leader here."

Some of these areas are still struggling to recover from the devastation of the civil war, and the once famous Trans-Caspian Railway has remained abandoned for nearly a decade.

In recent years, Junaid-Khan has been losing both his legitimacy and prestige among the population of his state. However, on the advice of one of his cronies, Aziz-Khan Chapik, to raise his prestige and legitimacy, Junaid-Khan needed an ideology capable of rallying people around his figure.
