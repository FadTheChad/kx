citycapturesmall.1.t:0 "The Second Battle of Verdun"
citycapturesmall.1.d:0 "It was inevitable that conflict between France and another nation would cause Verdun's fortifications to come under siege once more. The bunkers that constituted the defenses had been modernized plenty since the Weltkrieg, but so too had the gunnery that an invading force could wield to turn all such progress into smoldering rubble. Just as before, the fighting had started with an artillery duel between the two armies present, alongside a spectacular aerial skirmish. The gunnery of the attackers, alongside their tenacious will in assaulting the French bunker systems, had ultimately pushed Verdun's overseers towards the Meuse. Room to room fighting overtook the aged "castles" nearby, and a bitter reality set in: Despite the advances of armament, the infamous meat grinder of the First Weltkrieg would materialize once more.\n\nDespite this, the defenders had been either commanded to retake the initiative or, in the case of a few regiments, attempted to do so themselves against orders. The national pride associated with Verdun, and the psychological loss that would come with its possible capture, had forced anyone with a command authority or those who held the cause of France close to the heart to adopt a relentless, if also "insane", posture. To the shouts of "Ils ne passeront pas!", the French soldiers, if heroic, aggressively charged against the fortifying enemy positions on their former territory. A brutal fight over soiled earth and rubble resulted in the attackers needing to send more of their own men into the fray, especially as artillery from across the river began firing upon them. Casualties mounted further upon both sides, but in the end fortune would not smile on the French as it had before.\n\nThis time, it was not only artillery that the French defenders in their innumerable counter-attacks were exposed to, but fire from advanced air power and automatic weaponry of the modern era. Artillery shells were aided by dive bombing and incendiary payloads from bombers that remnant, antiquated anti-air could not hope to reach, quickly turning the lands around Fort Douaumont and Fort Vaux into mass graveyards. As the bend of the Meuse itself nearby began to grow choked with the waste left from war, flesh and steel alike, the French forces had ultimately been forced to swallow the bitter cup.\n\nVerdun had been lost, and a [ROOT.GetAdjective] flag now flew above the battered symbol of what was once a symbol of French strength in the face of overwhelming odds."
