OTT_find_turkish_dissidents:0 "Eliminate Dissident Intellectuals"
OTT_find_turkish_dissidents_desc:0 "Some sneaky intellectuals and overly curious journalists suspect that something is wrong with the current governance of the Empire, seeing well that this abrupt change of government was suspicious. Discreetly arresting or 'disappearing' all these enemies of Germany to prevent their theses from spreading among the population should be amongst our top priorities."

OTT_ease_religion_desc:0 "The rule of Islam is well established in these lands, however many minorities inhabit this vast Empire, in order to ensure that they will be on our side if things go wrong, we must give them more rights to practice their faith and get rid of the archaic laws that discriminate against them."

Among them we can count the archaeologist, orientalist, patron and spy Max von Oppenheim, a baron expert on the Orient.

It's high time to rectify the mistakes of the past, Max von Oppenheim will be ordered to recreate the 'Jihad Bureau' he formed during the Weltkrieg, playing on the Islamist sentiments of the local population to better control, appease and redirect them towards Germany's enemies.

OTT_germany_in_middle_east_desc:0 "The victory of the German Empire over the liberal French and British regimes and the backward Russian autocrats is the proof that our political system is the better of the two worlds.

OTT_german_institutions:0 "The Dawn of Ottoman Constitutionalism"
OTT_german_institutions_desc:0 "The system of 'Prussian constitutionalism' applied in the Kaiserreich is undoubtedly the most important element of the German political system, a semi-constitutional monarchy ensuring representation of the people and aristocratic interests, while supporting the Sovereign's position without making him an autocrat.

OTT_trust_elites_desc:0 "Our initial mission is coming to an end, we've secured the Empire's borders militarily and solved its immediate problems, it's time to leave governance to the Ottomans. However, giving it to the dangerous Kemalist reformers or the suicidal decentralists is out of the question, so we must call on the former Grand Vizier and Ottoman ambassador to Germany, Ahmet Tevfik Pasha. With the support of the Ottoman elite, this man will undoubtedly be able to keep the Empire together, while aligning it with our interests. Let's recommend him to the Sultan as soon as possible."

OTT_force_sultans_hand:0 "The Perfect Puppet"
OTT_force_sultans_hand_desc:0 "We have no love for Abdülmecid II, but he proved to be a perfect figurehead for us, appeasing the Ottomans as Sultan and the Muslims as Caliph.

OTT_unity_in_faith:0 "Brothers in Islam"
OTT_unity_in_faith_desc:0 "Our Empire is made up of dozens of different peoples, each with their own specific traditions and customs, and it would be foolish to want to establish Turkish supremacy in the political and cultural sphere, as Kemal wanted. Let's concentrate on the element common to the majority of the Empire, our faith in Islam. With the help of the IMF and religious elites, we will unify our vast Empire behind our government and the Sultan."

OTT_militaristic_nature:0 "Bet on the German Conglomerates"
OTT_militaristic_nature_desc:0 "So far, German investors have made the Empire way more wealthy, why stop there? Let's invite the great German conglomerates, such as Krupp or Siemens, to open up multiple industries and give jobs to our subjects, which will also contribute to the enrichment of the Ottoman aristocrats, a well-deserved reward since the stability of the Empire rests on their shoulders."

OTT_more_than_a_junta:0 "Promote Ottoman-German Businesses"
OTT_more_than_a_junta_desc:0 "There's no doubt that German investors have helped lift our Empire off the economic slope, but we mustn't forget to preserve our independence above all else. Let's encourage our subjects to open their own businesses in cooperation with German companies, allowing economic development to benefit both nations while reducing our dependence on Germany."

OTT_train_our_officers:0 "An Olive Branch to the Liberals"
OTT_train_our_officers_desc:0 "Our big reform projects can't be carried out by the ambassador alone, but fortunately Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff has many connections and friends in the liberal Ottoman political sphere, such as the leader of the Democratic Party, Musa Kazim Pasa himself. With his support, the reforms should be quicker and more popular with the Ottoman population and political elites alike."

OTT_schools_of_sciences:0 "An Empire of Reason"
OTT_schools_of_sciences_desc:0 "The Kemalists were right about one thing: the slow development of the Empire was largely due to its submission to religious dogma.

OTT_invite_kaiser:0 "Affirm Our Rule"
OTT_invite_kaiser_desc:0 "The Ottoman Empire is no more, at least not as an independent entity, its former lands are now the property of the Kaiser's loyal soldiers that we are.

OTT_affirm_loyalty:0 "Reward Loyal Collaborators"
OTT_affirm_loyalty_desc:0 "It would have been very hard to maintain this German structure of administration of the Ottoman lands without counting our loyal Ottoman subjects as foundations. In order to boost cooperation on the part of the Ottoman peoples, we will grant privileges and rewards to those who prove themselves worthy of being subjects of the Kaiser. We will also ally ourselves with the local tribal monarchs and local religious elites just as we do in Africa to ensure the loyalty of the traditionalist populations."

OTT_civilisation_mission:0 "All for the Civilizing Mission"
OTT_civilisation_mission_desc:0 "The ultimate goal of colonialism is to spread superior Western values ​​in uncivilized lands in order to elevate populations to a level of civilization worthy of Europe and the civilized world. Let us propagate our culture, our ideology and our sciences, because it is our mission to do so, and we intend to fulfill it without fail, whatever the opinion of the terrorists claiming to be so-called 'resistants' to our mission.

kxott.1.a:0 "Why wouldn't we?"
kxott.1.b:0 "Not today."

kxott.2.t:0 "The Ottomans wish for assistance"
kxott.2.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire, our old ally and now ally, has given us a request for equipment, including guns and artillery batteries. Do we give them the equipment, or do they not need it?"
kxott.2.a:0 "Yeah, send them some equipment."
kxott.2.b:0 "They don't need it."

kxott.3.t:0 "Assistance from Germany"
kxott.3.d:0 "Germany, in their endless kindness and benevolence, has bestowed upon us the equipment requested. At last! We will be better able to supply our armies."
kxott.3.a:0 "Hurrah!"

kxott.4.t:0 "No Assistance"

kxott.5.t:0 "Handing over the Suez Canal"
kxott.5.d:0 "With the German Military Mission firmly in control of the Ottoman Empire, the staff of the Mission have decided to transfer control of the vital Suez Canal to the Kaiserreich. Publicly, this move is justified as a way to repay Germany for both helping us in the recent war with the Cairo Axis and also to pay off remaining debts from the Weltkrieg. Unofficially, the move is a clear attempt to sway those skeptical of the whole Ottoman ordeal back in Berlin."
kxott.5.a:0 "Quid Pro Quo..."

kxott.6.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire offers up the Suez!"
kxott.6.d:0 "With the recent success of the Ottoman Empire against the Cairo Axis with our aid, the Sultan's government has offered to transfer the Suez Canal to us. To the German public, the move makes little sense. While it is indeed greatly increasing our international standing, why they would hand over the most vital shipping port in the world over for free is unknown. To the upper echelons of the Kaiserreich however, this makes perfect sense. With our Military Mission in nigh total power, it only makes sense for them to give us this most vital of shipping lanes. Afterall, without us, how can they hope to successfully carve out a German presence in the Middle-East? "
kxott.6.a:0 "A toast to our Ottoman friends!"

kxott.7.t:0 "Business with the Ottomans"
kxott.7.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire, a new ally for the Reichspakt, has been engaging in business ventures and trading with our Mittelafrikan colony. The business we exchange with each other has proven beneficial to the nation, with revenue going up and likewise our stability."

kxott.8.t:0 "Turkish Dissidents Located"
kxott.8.d:0 "The Turks who know too much, who know about the German shadow government, have been located. There isn't much time before they move again, so von Schellendorf has ordered an immediate squad to be sent out to deal with them, and by deal with them we mean kill them, and leave no traces. The world will forget about them."
kxott.8.a:0 "Deal with them, now!"

kxott.13.t:0 "The Ottomans at war!"
kxott.13.d:0 "Our old Weltkrieg ally, the Ottoman Empire, has been engulfed in the flames of war! We may receive them as an ally later as a result from aid, but then again, we are freely giving away equipment to them, and they may not even win."

kxott.15.d:0 "With the Ottoman Empire struggling in a war against Egypt and its Cairo Axis, the Ottoman Empire stands in danger. Its army is already seeing failure. Perhaps the first military mission wasn't enough, and a second military mission may be needed to sharpen the Ottoman soldiers..."

kxott.19.a:0 "We should tread carefully."

kxott.20.t:0 "The German Military Mission Fully Takes Over!"
kxott.20.d:0 "With the failure of the Ottoman military to deal with the threats at hand, Fritz Bronsart von Schellendorf has grown powerful enough in the Ottoman military to warrant a complete shadow takeover of the government, the Sultan has announced that he is dismissing the current government and appointing a 'provisional government' made up of apolitical politicians, but in reality this is just a facade, the men proposed will only be a fake government put in place while we centralize power around the German mission.\n\nWhile the soldiers do not know about this transfer of leadership, and neither does the citizenry, a few members of the Ottoman government have fled and prepare to spread the word. As for us, hopefully this sudden change in leadership will break the stalemate and lead to a great Ottoman victory..."
