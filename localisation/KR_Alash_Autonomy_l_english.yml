POLITICS_ALIKHAN_BUKEIKHANOV_DESC: "Born in 1866, Älihan Bökeihan was a part of the Qazaq upper class from birth - he was a direct descendant of the khans of the Bukei Horde, an autonomous Qazaq state which surrendered to the Russians in the 19th century. He acquired his higher education in St. Petersburg and grew up influenced by Kadet liberalism and moderate socialism - ultimately, this drew him to become a member of the Kadets and a diligent campaigner for Qazaq independence. After the Revolution of 1905, he split off to found the Alash Party - a moderate liberal political party advocating for an autonomous Qazaq entity in a greater Russia. This dream became real after the February Revolution of 1917, when thanks to Aleksandr Kerenskiy's support, Bukeikhanov was sent to Kazakstan in order to organize a congress of Kazaks in Semipalatinsk. \n\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the Alash Autonomy became a battleground between several factions, although it eventually managed to assert the integrity of its territory. Having achieved the primary goal of his life, Bukeikhanov retired from his position as President and allowed democracy to take charge. Until 1925, that is. A war between the Alash Autonomy and Turkestan, and the Kolchak Coup in Russia turned the Autonomy's continued existence untenable. Bukeikhanov was placed back in charge by junior Qazaq officers and granted wide-reaching emergency powers to resolve the crisis - and ultimately, he did. Southern raids and Russian integrationist tendencies have forced him to continue the state of emergency. At this point, the 70 year old Bukeikhanov is simply... tired. Especially tired of the Russians. And as long as he is given a chance, he will not hesitate to break the Autonomy away from this rotten structure."

It emerged from the reaction of Qazaq intelligentsia, dissatisfied with the program of Alash party, their ideas were a combination of ideology of Russian SRs and Islamic traditional movements. Nevertheless, the Üsh-Jüzovites enjoyed very little popularity and soon became disillusioned with the Provisional Government and were supported by the Bolsheviks.\nAfter the defeat of the Reds, a new chapter in the history of the party began. One of the party members, part-time head of the cultural society \"Jas Qazaq\", a national teacher, poet and writer, Saken Seyfullin, secured his election as party leader.

ALO_cossack_garrison: "Cossack Menace"
ALO_cossack_garrison_desc: "In 1925, the leader of the Orenburg Cossacks, Ataman Dutov, joined Kolchak's Putsch and put the Cossack army in Orenburg on alert, ready to support the putschists. Despite the fact that the coup failed, Dutov wanted to follow Krasnov's example and declare Orenburg's independence. However, the Russian government made concessions and transferred Orenburg to the Alash autonomy, imposing Cossack autonomy on our country and securing its southern borders. All this has led to the fact that the Cossacks are actually running Orenburg, oppressing the local population in every possible way and periodically threatening our government. As long as we are weak and completely dependent on Russia, we cannot do anything with the violent Cossacks."
ALO_land_troubles: "Nomadic Economy"

Under the treatises declaring our national autonomy, we are to respect and accommodate these Russians, giving them special privileges and diplomatic immunities. The discrepancy in influence between the minority Russians and majority Kazaks has created heated ethnic conflicts, and even a form of segregation as most Kazaks fled to the southern lands, away from Russian settlements in the north. As if that wasn’t bad enough, the settlers themselves are also frequently in conflict with other ethnic groups such as Cossacks and Uyghurs."
ALO_legacy_of_central_asian_revolt: "Legacy of Central Asian Revolt"
ALO_legacy_of_central_asian_revolt_desc: "We spent five decades under Russian hegemony, which caused irreparable damage to our culture and led to our lands being overrun by Russian settlers. In 1916, the people of Central Asia decided that enough was enough and revolted. We fought long and hard, using the Russian civil war to regain our old territories. Eventually we regained our freedom, but the price we paid was almost unbearable. A huge part of our population was exterminated or deported from Central Asia, forced to seek refuge in the Chinese territory of Xinjiang. The Qazaq and Kyrgyz populations were particularly devastated by this. A small number of refugees are now migrating back to Turkestan, hoping to return to their old homes. The uprising in Central Asia marked the birth of the Mojahedin, or, as the Russians contemptuously call them, \"Basmachi\", as an organized military and political movement; it served as the last straw that finally won our independence. We will never forget what the Russians did to us and what they took from us. We will never bow to them again.

### Events ###
alash.1.t: "White Sun of the Desert"
alash.1.d: "Alash Autonomy emerged immediately after the Bolshevik putsch in Petrograd and the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly at the dawn of 1918. In fact, Alash autonomy was not an instant decision; it was the culmination of decades of colonialism and the bitter scars uncovered by the Central Asian uprising of 1916. Alash-Orda rose as a regional force, becoming an important player in the civil war, agreeing to the bitter conditions imposed by the White Government of Kolchak.\n\nAfter the war ended, a special relationship developed between local Qazaq leaders and the new republican government in Petrograd. Alash-Orda was never conceived as a separatist movement; it was a modernist movement, a reaction to the obsolete tsarist bureaucracy and the slow decline of Qazaq culture under the influence of the Russian boot.\n\nWith a more liberal government in control of Russia, the Alash Orda (whose key members were mostly Kadets) forged the necessary alliances and struck the necessary deals to achieve a degree of self-government."
alash.1.a: "Interesting"

alash.899.t: "Alash Party & Halyq Keńesi"
alash.899.d: "Since 1917, the country has been ruled by Älihan Bukeykhanov, leader of the Alash Party, a close associate of Kerensky, the father of the Qazaq state. The country's parliament is the Halyq Keńesi, or People's Council, largely modeled on the Russian Duma. Elections are synchronized with the Russian elections, and the Prime Minister is also elected. For many years, the People's Council has remained virtually one-party, as the Alash Party leads the parliament nearly undisputed.\n\nAmong the opposition to the ruling regime are Jas Azamat - formerly the youth branch of Alash, but now a full-fledged leftist party with little representation in the parliament; the Qosshy Union - affiliated with leftist and center-left Russian SRs; and the Orenburg Cossacks - having their target quotas in the National Council based on the 1926 Orenburg Treaty."
alash.899.a: "Wake up, Qazaq!"

alash.898.t: "Dutov's Firm Hand Over Orenburg"
alash.898.d: "When Kolchak's putsch struck Russia in 1925, the Orenburg Cossacks initially opposed Kerensky's regime, together with the Don and Kuban Cossacks. However, Kerensky was able to convince the pragmatic Dutov to lay down his arms by offering Orenburg a special autonomous status. The situation was aggravated by the fact that the Kazaks, who had long claimed the Orenburg province, finally got it... but with Dutov and the Cossacks in tow. \n\nAll this led to the fact that we have virtually no control over Western Kazakstan, and Dutov had already spread his influence informally to Uralsk. The Orenburg Cossacks are also causing a lot of problems in the People's Council and are also actively involved in colonization to the East. There are even rumors reaching the central government that the local Qazaq population is being driven out of their ancestral territories, which the Cossacks are occupying."
alash.898.a: "Something must be done."

alash.897.t: "Assassination of President Kerensky"
alash.897.d: "Alarming news reached our capital from Petrograd, where a few hours ago President Kerensky, a friend and associate of Älihan Bukeykhanov, an associate and great supporter of Alash autonomy, who had done much for federal Russia, was killed.\n\nThe terrorist murderer should undoubtedly pay for his deeds, but it seems that Kerensky was the one who was able to hold the delicate balance of Russian politics in his hands, and now everything has gone into tatters. While chaos reigns in Russia, the Alash autonomy has declared mourning for the Russian president and has lowered both Russian and Alash flags."
alash.897.a: "He can be criticized, but could you be in his shoes?"

alash.896.t: "Dutov Makes His Move"
alash.896.d: "Along with the chaos reigning in Russia, the control over our autonomy weakened, and it was not us, as one would expect, but the notorious Orenburg Cossacks who decided to take advantage of it.\n\nYesterday, leaving their cozy fiefdom in Orenburg, the Cossacks actually established power over the Urals, claiming that the territories of the abolished Urals Cossack Army should also receive wide autonomy. Before their power spreads to the entire region, and in particular to the town of [ALO_guryev_kazakh], action must be taken. Without the patronage of President Kerensky, it will be difficult to come to an agreement with the Cossacks and keep them from committing crimes against our statehood and territorial integrity."
alash.896.a: "Another city lost to cossacks!"

alash.895.t: "Rumors of Älihan Bökeihan's Resignation"
alash.895.d.death: "Today rumors reached the government of the Alash Orda that Älihan Bukeykhanov, deeply saddened by the death of his friend... President Kerensky, and also probably taking his age into account, intends to resign, for the first time allowing a new man to take the honorable place of Prime Minister of the young Qazaq democracy.\n\nSo far, however, there has been no official confirmation of such information, but rumors soon leaked out to the media, and many Kazaks read in the morning papers that the father of the nation was preparing to leave his post.\n\nIn a sense, the unprecedented excitement over such news prompted members of the media to contact the government for comment, after which a press release was announced at which Bukeykhanov was scheduled to speak.\n\nOn the appointed morning, a conference of the most influential acting ministers was assembled, headed by Älihan Bukeykhanov himself, who announced the beginning of a new era for the Alash autonomy. The Father of the Nation spoke at length about the possibilities for modernizing and improving the living conditions of ordinary Kazaks, and finally, at the end of his speech, made an important announcement, finally putting an end to all the rumors surrounding his resignation."
alash.895.d.age: "Today rumors reached the government of the Alash Orda that Älihan Bukeykhanov, probably taking his age into account, intends to resign, for the first time allowing a new man to take the honorable place of Prime Minister of the young Qazaq democracy.\n\nSo far, however, there has been no official confirmation of such information, but rumors soon leaked out to the media, and many Kazaks read in the morning papers that the father of the nation was preparing to leave his post.\n\nIn a sense, the unprecedented excitement over such news prompted members of the media to contact the government for comment, after which a press release was announced at which Bukeykhanov was scheduled to speak.\n\nOn the appointed morning, a conference of the most influential acting ministers was assembled, headed by Älihan Bukeykhanov himself, who announced the beginning of a new era for the Alash autonomy.

alash.895.b: "The rumors are confirmed and Bukeykhanov resigns..."

# Russia goes Snap Elections #
alash.893.t: "Extraordinary Elections Announced!"
alash.893.d: "In connection with the death of President Kerensky, general elections were announced in Russia, and our autonomy, as part of a federal republic, was also obliged to hold them. Usually the Qazaq population predominantly voted for the Alash party, and we even won a significant number of deputies in the all-Russian Duma, but in recent years, due to the growing popularity of Üsh-Jüz and Jas Azamat, which form unified lists with candidates from Russian parties, our majoritarianism was lost.\n\nIn general, the interest of the Qazaq population to the all-Russian elections has faded, and the turnout is quite low, but the Russians and Cossack migrants vote for Russian parties, and in recent years their support has changed towards right-wing nationalist parties, such as NRPR and VNS. We must keep an eye on these elections and not allow non-indigenous Russians to represent our autonomy in the Russian parliament."
alash.893.a: "Let us hope Russia won't fall into electoral nightmare"

alash.892.t: "Alash Party Primaries" # -> alash.888
alash.892.d: "In connection with Bukeykhanov's resignation and the scheduling of elections to the Halyq Keńesi in the near future, the Alash Party convened a congress to elect a candidate from the party who would become prime minister and form the government.\n\nIn recent years, the party has lost much in unity and cohesion, and is now in fact no longer a party but a coalition of political cliques. On the left flank, the Alash party is represented by a group of politicians who did not leave the party after the formation of Jas Azamat, united under the leadership of Jakhanshi Dosmukhamedov. They are quite radical in their policy, intending to reform the party from within and drastically change inequality.\n\nThe progressive wing of the party is represented by Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, a close associate of Bukeykhanov, who was predicted to be his successor, but his radical liberalism and strong personal power base alienated the more moderate Alash-Ordinians, who preferred the more pragmatic Yermekov.\n\nThe moderate centrists are represented precisely by him, Bukeykhanov's "named" successor, who has secured the support of the Alash Party establishment, and who serves as the "voice of Reason" of the party. Politicians who want to preserve the status quo and are afraid of rocking the boat are united around him.\n\nFinally, opposed on the right is Sadyk Amanjolov - the creator of the People's Militia of the Alash Orda, a military leader and defender of the Qazaq people, a nationalist who advocates the development of the army and finally the separation from Russia, prophesied by the Central Asian uprising of 1916."
alash.892.a: "Jahansha Dosmukhamedov, Alash Party's leftist."
alash.892.b: "Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, radical liberal."
alash.892.c: "Alimkhan Yermekov, follower of Bukeikhanov's vision."
alash.892.e: "Sadyk Amanjolov, Qazaq nationalist."

# Russia goes Civil War or Revolution #

alash.890.t: "Revolution in Russia"
alash.890.d: "Revolution happens in Russia, and now it becomes obvious that we should cut our ties with the treacherous socialist government, that fought against our independence in the first civil war. However, the question arises if we should stay loyal to the Russian Volunteer Army, led by Lavr Kornilov, the government, based in Volgograd. While their government is likely to fight for united and indivisible Russia, we have previously agreed to become an autonomy."
alash.890.a: "Announce our support for Kornilov's regime!" #-> Rise of Qosshy (wneh civil war starts)
alash.890.b: "It is high time to declare independence and stay out of this!" 

# Russian Elections #

alash.889.t: "Votes Counted in Petrograd"
alash.889.d.friendly: "This description is shown if a friendly government to us is elected in Russia. As we are a part of Russia, we have elections at the same time, though we share great autonomy. If the government elected, however, is chauvinistic or anti-autonomist, it will get us into problems."
alash.889.d.enemies: "This description is shown if not a friendly government to us is elected in Russia. As we are a part of Russia, we have elections at the same time, though we share great autonomy. If the government elected, however, is chauvinistic or anti-autonomist, it will get us into problems."
alash.889.a: "At least they are our allies"
alash.889.b: "A dangerous result."

# United Front failure #

alash.888.t: "Alash Unity Under Threat"
alash.888.d: "The once united Alash party has long since cracked, but now the split has only intensified after a candidate from a single bloc of political cliques was elected in the primaries. All factions, except for the winning one, were dissatisfied with the results, and are already openly declaring distrust of the Alash Central Committee and the new candidate. \n\nSupporters of the winning candidate assure that only Älihan Bukeykhanov can save the situation, who should name a successor himself and thereby unite the party, probably for the last time, but skeptics state that the party unity died once and for all, and nothing will help him, so it is easier to just admit it as a fact."
alash.888.a: "The unity of the party has died out."
alash.888.b: "Bukeikhanov should intervene and name a successor!"

alash.887.t: "Bukeikhanov Names His Successor"
alash.887.d: "Älihan Bukeykhanov spoke today at a meeting of the Alash Central Committee with intentions to announce his successor - which from a formal legal point of view, of course, does not change the situation in any way, and the candidate elected in the primaries will remain in his place. It is the symbolic importance of Älihan that will be important, and perhaps in this way the candidate he names will be able to gain popularity with the people and seize the initiative in the future.\n\nNevertheless, the name named will hardly come as a surprise to everyone. Earlier, Bukeykhanov worked closely with Dulatuly, but times have changed and for the past six years another party member, Alimkhan Yermekov, has firmly established a nickname of successor. That is why, when the aged father of the nation uttered the cherished name, the delegates did not breathe a sigh of relief, but only realized that the time of struggle had just begun. Yermekov did become the named successor of Bukeykhanov, but whether it would somehow affect the unity of the party - rather for the worse."
alash.887.a: "There are doubts that it can heal the wounds of the party"

alash.886.t: "The Race Starts" #-> alash.885
alash.886.d: "After the primaries and the beginning of the active campaign of the party, the campaign was actually sabotaged by members from other factions. Party unity is practically at zero, but those who disagree with the results of the vote for a candidate are outraged and do not seem to allow him to be elected.\n\nThat is why in fact all 4 candidates took part in the race for the Prime Minister's seat and deployed their campaign headquarters.\n\nJakhansha Dosmukhamedov, Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, Alimkhan Yermekov and Sadyk Amanjolov - for the first time 4 candidates were nominated from Alash party and for the first time it was not Älihan Bukeykhanov. These elections promise to be interesting, but the most frightening thing for Alash, which held power for many years, is whether such clear split in the party is a tidbit and good timing for the opposition, which is increasing its power and offers people an alternative. Alternative, which for the first time may be more promising than current system."
alash.886.a: "Let the strongest win"

alash.885.t: "'Battle' For [ALO_guryev_kazakh]"
alash.885.d: "The region of [ALO_guryev_kazakh] finds itself at the heart of a political struggle. This area serves as the stronghold of the western wing of Alash, led by Jansha Dosmukhamedov. However, Jansha's influence is threatened as the Center of the party hesitates to fully support him. The local Cossack presence is strong, raising concerns about the potential dominance of their interests in the region.\n\nThe nationalist wing of Alash proposes a decisive move to secure victory. They advocate for the introduction of militia troops into [ALO_guryev_kazakh], a measure that could guarantee the triumph of the Alash cause. Yet, this approach comes at a price, as it involves resorting to undemocratic measures."
alash.885.a: "The Western wing of Alash gets the support of Center" #-> Jansha wins, aligns with Dulatuly
alash.885.b: "We should not help this leftist hotbed!" #-> Dutov wins, Jansha aligns with Jas Azamat 
alash.885.c: "Introduce Militia troops into [ALO_guryev_kazakh]" #-> Nationalists get support

alash.884.t: "Cossacks Solidify Result in [ALO_guryev_kazakh]"
alash.884.d: "The strategic decision to withhold support from the western wing of Alash has now manifested as a concrete outcome. Ataman Dutov and his Cossacks have capitalized on the absence of assistance and have successfully solidified their control over the region of [ALO_guryev_kazakh]. Their influence has grown, and they have managed to secure a significant victory in this pivotal area.\n\nThe lack of intervention has given the Cossacks the upper hand, allowing them to bolster their position and potentially reshape the political landscape in their favor."
alash.884.a: "We've lost the West" 

alash.883.t: "Jansha Dosmukhamedov Supports Jas Azamat"
alash.883.d: "The aftermath of the Cossack victory in [ALO_guryev_kazakh has set off a chain of significant political shifts. Jansha Dosmukhamedov, the leader of the western wing of Alash, has taken a momentous step. In response to the altered dynamics, he has chosen to sever ties with the Alash party coalition and form an alliance with the oppositional social-democratic party Jas Azamat."
alash.883.a: "Tragic for the election results!"

alash.882.t: "Alash Secures Electoral Victory in [ALO_guryev_kazakh]"
alash.882.d: "The calculated decision to provide support to the western wing of Alash has yielded a significant outcome. The party's efforts to strengthen its position in the region of [ALO_guryev_kazakh] have borne fruit, as they emerge victorious in the local elections.\n\nThis triumph not only reinforces Alash's influence in the region but also safeguards a vital stronghold against the encroaching dominance of the Cossacks. The successful election outcome serves as a testament to the effectiveness of strategic intervention in the political process."
alash.882.a: "Another stronghold against the cossacks."

alash.881.t: "Qazaq Nationalists Clash With Cossacks"
alash.881.d: "In the heart of [ALO_guryev_kazakh], a tumultuous clash of ideologies and ambitions plays out in vivid hues. Qazaq nationalists, fuelled by a passionate yearning for self-determination and the revival of their distinct cultural identity, find themselves locked in a fierce confrontation with the entrenched Cossack presence. The cobblestone streets, once pathways of shared heritage, now resonate with the echoes of discord as historical grievances and aspirations intermingle.\n\nThe air is charged with tension, grievances accumulated over generations converging into a volatile present. The scent of conflict is palpable as impassioned speeches reverberate through the squares, framing the battle as a struggle for the soul of [ALO_guryev_kazakh]. Beneath the surface, currents of history, nationalism, and power collide, shaping the very foundations of the region's future. As both sides rally their supporters and assert their right to shape the course of [ALO_guryev_kazakh], the outcome remains uncertain, weighed down by the weight of historical scars."
alash.881.a: "Call for Russian intervention!"

With the weight of political calculation, Russia intervenes on the side of Dutov and his steadfast Cossacks, casting a mantle of influence over the region. \n\nThe move by Russia is more than mere intervention; it's a statement that reverberates across the region and beyond. The choices and allegiances of those within [ALO_guryev_kazakh] ripple through the currents of international relations, highlighting the interconnectedness of even seemingly localized struggles.

The choices and confrontations that have defined the struggle for control now intersect with the broader currents of geopolitical strategy.\n\nThe orchestration of Dutov's withdrawal is an intricate dance of diplomacy and coercion, revealing the extent to which external powers can shape the internal dynamics of a nation. As the curtain falls on Dutov's influence in [ALO_guryev_kazakh], a vacuum is left in his wake, a void that sparks both new possibilities and a heightened sense of uncertainty.

The declaration of martial law casts a long shadow, its implications echoing through the region's history and foreshadowing the sacrifices necessary to maintain order. The very essence of [ALO_guryev_kazakh]'s democratic process is at stake, prompting questions about the balance between stability and the fundamental rights of its citizens.

However, numerous politicans have suggested their own variants and even included them in their programmes.\n\nThe idea, shared by the pro-Russian political cliques is to adopt a Cyrillic alphabet in order to have a better communication with the Russians - and also it will make life for the Russian settlers and Cossacks easier, who already developed some king of Russian transliteration. The nationalist clique, however, is strongly opposed to this and claims that we should find inspiration in Ottoman Empire's reform and, as much of the Muslim World, adopt the Latin alphabet. The last, but not the least group thinks that staying with the traditional Arabic script is much prefered and shows our true sovereignity and independence from any foreign opinion."
alash.48.a: "Adopt the Cyrillic - for better mutual understanding with the Russians."
alash.48.b: "Adopt the Latin - we must modernize, not be colonized."
alash.48.c: "Jana emle shall stay for years to come."

alash.52.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
alash.52.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] ministry of economy has refused to send us any additional investment. It seems that we are on our own now and even our 'masters' don't want to help their constituent entity!"

alash.35.t: "Independence for Alash Autonomy?"
alash.35.d: "The main issue, discussed at the Third All-Kazakh Congress was if Alash Autonomy should finally declare independence from Russia. While half of the ministers and senators claim that the time has come to throw off the chains of Russian oppression and end the farce of Alash-Orda being part of Russia, the other half, however, consisting mostly of ethnic Russians and Cossacks, believe that there will be no Kazakstan without Russian assistance."
alash.35.a: "No, we must remain loyal to Russia."
alash.35.b: "Declare full independence from Russia."

alash.43.t: "On the other side of Syr Darya"
alash.43.d: "On the opposite bank of the river Syr Darya lies the Islamic Federation of Turkestan - a reactionary and militarized country which shares common origins and culture with us.

alash.49.t: "Orenburg Cossack Host"
alash.49.d: "While Orenburg is not located in Alash Autonomy, the Ataman of Orenburg Cossacks, Dutov, is a close friend of Vasily Balabanov. He was one of the first political leaders in Russia to recognize our state and now his Cossack troops are disposed in Alash, securing our state. However, he did not recognize the leadership of Kerensky after the Civil War. The Kazakh army almost entirely depends on Cossacks and the assistance of Ataman Dutov is vital for our state. We should think of granting Cossack special status in Alash-Orda, the one that will be much higher than of a regular Kazakh."
alash.49.a: "Grant Special Status to Cossacks"

alash.57.t: "Union with [DKB.GetName]?"
alash.57.d: "The social class of cossacks, though always having special privelege from the Russian government, has been separated and humbled into the dust by the failed republican Russian government.

alash.60.d: "The government of Ataman Dutov has offered us an alliance against Petrograd regime."
alash.60.b: "Why should we die for this crazy Ataman?"
alash.60.c: "Orenburg Military District should be created."

alash.61.t: "Cossacks Overthrow Our Government!"
alash.61.d: "Our policy towards cossacks has angered their community in our country. Today, several armed cossack garrisons entered the capital city, led by Ataman Dutov. After a short battle with the local police force, he arrested the government and proclaimed himself dictator of the nation."
alash.61.a: "Long live Ataman Dutov!"

alash.62.t: "Offer From Vladivostok"
alash.62.d: "Kolchak suggested that we should become a 'Military District', recognizing Vladivostok's full authority over us."

alash.64.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has decisevely protested against Kazakhization, especially in Kyrgyz and Uzbek minorities areas in several our regions, most notably in [589.GetName]. We can refuse politely or outright say that we will do anything we want on our territories."

alash.66.d: "The traitorous Alash government refused to end Kazakhization in regions with significant Kyrgyz minority, greatly damaging our relations."

alash.100.t: "Join [SOV.GetNameDefCap]?"
alash.100.d: "The recent victories of socialists in Russian and Kazakstan have shown close ties between our countries. The new government of Kazakstan believes that we should join [SOV.GetName] in our common struggle against imperalists and capitalists."

alash.200.t: "[FROM.GetName] Claims Our Territories"
alash.200.d.puppet: "The government of [FROM.GetName] has claimed some of the bordering territories, which has a significant minority of Kazakhs. We can meet our Kazakh friends halfway and separate these territories from our country, effectively transferring the regions under the control of the [FROM.GetAdjective] government. On the other hand, we can maintain these regions under our formal control and increase Kazakh autonomy in these territories, allowing national-cultural autonomy in some way. Nevertheless, we can always just outright deny their request."
alash.200.d: "The government of [FROM.GetName] has claimed some of the bordering territories, which has a significant minority of Kazakhs. Despite the fact that the Kazakhs have decided to declare their independence, we can try to find advantages in their offer and bring them back under our control. Firstly, we can exchange these territories in response to the conclusion of a contract for the supply of a large percentage of their harvest on preferential terms. Secondly, we can directly offer them to rejoin Russia on the rights of broad autonomy, and then the issue of land transfer will be only a formality."
alash.200.a: "Let them have it for free."
alash.200.b: "Create a national-cultural autonomy in these regions."
alash.200.c: "We must have a proportion of their harvest instead."
alash.200.e: "Only if they once again become our autonomy."
alash.200.f: "Just deny their request."

alash.201.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
alash.201.d: "To our great surprise, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to hand over the territories we claimed. This is a great victory for our nation!"

alash.204.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to fully transfer these territories unless we sign an economic treaty, that will grant the [FROM.GetAdjective]s almost half of our yield.

alash.204.a: "Sure..."
alash.204.b: "That's nonsense!"

alash.205.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
alash.205.d: "To our great surprise, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to sign the treaty. Now they are again under our dependence, even if they not fully undestand these. Let them have these territories."
alash.205.a: "Great!"

alash.206.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
alash.206.d: "Unfortunately, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused our terms. That means that they won't have their lands as well."
alash.206.a: "We will get them later."

alash.207.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Our Submission In Exchange!"
alash.207.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to return our territories only if we once again become their autonomy. Even if this will piss off literally every citizen, we will receive protection and territories."

alash.212.t: "Russian Influence Increased"
alash.212.d: "Russian influence over our country due to the Treaty of Kostanai has increased a lot, with us becoming heavily dependent on the Russians. It seems that now nothing can stop Russia from thoroughly integrating us into their country!"

alash.300.d: "The Russian Republic is in chaos,society is radicalizing and the economy is falling. Älihan Bökeihan has announced that the Third All-Kazakh Congress should be held immediately in order to solve some up to date issues. On the one hand, Älihan is hoping to finally break away from Russia and secure Kazakh independence. But on the other hand, cutting ties with Russia can lead to serious problems, both political and economical. Moreover, being almost 70 years old, Bukeikhanov is thinking of retirement and quiet rest somewhere near the Balkash lake. There are also talks about the retirement of the old leader in the government, especially amongs the Young Alash wing of the party. But the instability, which can be caused by retirement can play a joke on us and let the most radical factions seize the power."
alash.300.a: "We must choose wisely."

alash.301.t: "Society Radicalized"
alash.301.d: "The decision of Bukeikhanov to remain loyal to Russia has provoked a massive unrest among the delegates.
