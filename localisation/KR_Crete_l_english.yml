### Ideas ###
CRE_med_base:0 "German Mediterranean Base"
CRE_med_base_desc:0 "The island of Crete, especially with its naval base on the south coast, is one of the Kaiser's beloved Mediterranean naval outposts. First earned during the fallout of the Great War as Greece was forced to lease Crete's naval bases to Germany while the island itself was placed under the control of an autonomous civilian government that favors neither Athens or Berlin, Crete is of vital importance to the German Empire's naval maneuvers and operations in the region, especially in regards to safeguarding the Kaiser's beloved new possession in Suez."
CRE_local_tensions:0 "Dual Power"
CRE_local_tensions_desc:0 "The German presence on Crete is limited to the small naval base on the southern coast. A civilian government governs the island nominally in the name of the Thunderbolt Regent. In actuality, the civilian government is but a pawn of the garrison, whom use them to keep the locals in check, to ensure the naval base runs without issue. The native Cretans know this, and many are unhappy at this state of affairs. Unless something happened that shook the garrison from its perch, German soft control over Crete is here to stay."

### Events ###

crete.1.t:0 "Georg Alexander von Müller Disappears"
crete.1.d:0 "Partisans, long dissatisfied with German Rule over the Island of Crete have finally made their move today, kidnapping longtime Governor of the Island Georg Alexander von Müller. Müller's car was ambushed while en route from his residence to his divisional headquarters. Müller was tied and forced into the back seat while two partisans impersonated him and his driver respectively. Müller's notorious impatience at roadblocks enabled the car to pass numerous checkpoints before being abandoned at the hamlet of Heliana. As of now the fate of Crete seems to be up in the air, as questions abound in the absence of our Governor."
crete.1.a:0 "Dreadful!"

crete.2.t:0 "Finding Müller"
crete.2.d:0 "Thousands of German Soldiers have been mobilized to hunt down the rats who have kidnapped our Governor. Müller's captors have made an unsuccessful attempt to flee to Egypt, yet have been stopped by a German Blockade. It has become clear in this time that any attempts made to escape the island would be in foolish, and they are left with two choices: surrender and hope for leniency, or execute Governor Müller and permanently end his tyranny over the island."
crete.2.a:0 "We Found him Just in Time!"
crete.2.b:0 "We were too late, the Governor is dead..."

crete.3.t:0 "A New Governor"
crete.3.d:0 "With Müller dying in a failed kidnapping attempt, a new Governor is needed for our island. The choices are the more harsh Alexander Andrae, the more moderate Theo Osterkamp, or the paratrooper Walter Koch. "
crete.3.a:0 "Alexander Andrae."
crete.3.b:0 "Walter Koch."
crete.3.c:0 "Theo Osterkamp."

crete.4.t:0 "Restructuring"
crete.4.d:0 "With Black Monday striking the German Sphere, cutbacks must be made. The first place that came to mind for the bean-counters in Berlin was the German-Held island of Crete. Crete, while holding importance as the German Lynchpin in the Mediterranean, is a rebel-infested drain on the German Empire's finances. Cutting our losses and abandoning the Island to its fate would save us dearly needed funds. We could also attempt to sell the Island to one of its neighbors, who have long squabbles over the territory."
crete.4.a:0 "We have nothing, Sell the Damn Island..."
crete.4.b:0 "German Rule over Crete is Doomed, Prepare to Flee!"
crete.4.c:0 "We will hold on to Crete by any means!"

crete.5.t:0 "The Fate of Crete"
crete.5.d:0 "With the German Garrison evacuating Crete, a temporary civilian government has been formed to decide the future of Crete. The question on everyone's mind is what form the new State of Crete will take. Will we rejoin Greece? The Ottoman Empire? Shall we look to the Exiles for protection? All must be answered soon."
crete.5.a:0 "George Tzikas founds a Liberal-Conservative Democracy!"
crete.5.b:0 "Alexandros Zaimis establishes a Pro-Greek Regency Council!"
crete.5.c:0 "Patrick Leigh Fermor and his Entente Spies seize control!"

crete.6.t:0 "Chaos in the Fallschirmjäger Ranks"
crete.6.d:0 "The appointment of Walter Koch as Governor of Crete has allowed the prestigious Fallschirmjäger, or Paratroopers, to gain sway within the Military Governance of Crete. While typically ignored in the sphere of operations in the wider Empire, Crete has become a center of Paratrooper training and operations, with much of the German Brass experienced in the area moving to Crete. This has led to a new band of radicals who flavor new and radical forms of warfare gunning for Crete's top job."
crete.6.a:0 "Richard Heidrich Seizes Control and Establishes a Government Loyal to von Göring!"
crete.6.b:0 "Kurt Student Restores Order and stays with Berlin."

crete.7.t:0 "Rejoin the Homeland?"
crete.7.d:0 "With the German Empire being expelled from Crete's shores, the question of re-union with Greece has emerged. While many are in favour of this, others are more skeptical of rejoining the Athens Government."
crete.7.a:0 "The Time has Come to Reunify!"
crete.7.b:0 "On Second Thought, let us Retain Independence!"

crete.8.t:0 "Crete Returns Home"
crete.8.d:0 "While this year has brought us catastrophe after catastrophe, it seems one piece of good news has trickled to [GRE.GetLeader]'s desk. The Island of Crete, formerly a German possession, has thrown off its chains and is now looking to rejoin Greece. Our humiliating loss of Crete has now been undone, as the Nation of Greece is one step closer to being whole."
crete.8.a:0 "Excellent News!"

crete.9.t:0 "Revolution in Crete"
crete.9.d:0 "It was hoped after the German Evacuation of Crete that the Island would return to Greek Rule, however that has turned out not to be the case as [CRE.GetLeader] has formally refused the prospect of rejoining Greece. This refusal has infuriated [GRE.GetLeader], who is mulling the possibility of using force to take back the now unprotected island."
crete.9.a:0 "Unacceptable, Launch an Invasion at Once!"
crete.9.b:0 "Such a thing would be Useless Bloodsh

crete.10.t:0 "Crete Rejoins Greece"
crete.10.d:0 "The outcome of the German abandonment of Crete was the Pro-Entente Partisans led by Patrick Leigh Fermor seizing control of the Island. Now with Greece also joining the Entente, negotiations for bringing Crete back in to the Greek Nation have succeeded. Now, Greece is one step closer to being whole. "
crete.10.a:0 "Wonderful!"

crete_sale.1.t:0 "The Cretan Question"
crete_sale.1.d:0 "With our economy in shambles after Black Monday, our Colonial Empire has been under fairly harsh scrutiny. The main territory that has been under examination is Crete. Crete is larger and harder to defend than Malta, and the upkeep is higher as well. To help with our deficit, it has been proposed that we essentially sell the island to either the Ottomans or the Greeks. What shall we do?"
crete_sale.1.a:0 "Keep Crete under our influence."
crete_sale.1.b:0 "Offer Crete to the Ottomans."
crete_sale.1.c:0 "Offer Crete to the Greeks."

crete_sale.2.t:0 "The Sale of Crete"
crete_sale.2.d:0 "The Germans have come offering the sale of Crete. While it would obviously cost us a sizeable amount of money, having the island once more would greatly strengthen our position in the Mediterranean. What shall our reply be?"
crete_sale.2.a:0 "Welcome home, Crete!"
crete_sale.2.b:0 "We do not need that rock."

crete_sale.3.t:0 "The Sale of Crete"
crete_sale.3.d:0 "The Ottoman Ambassador has sent a message to us, declaring that the Sultan has agreed to buy Crete. We have begun to transfer control of the Cretan State to them."
crete_sale.3.a:0 "Great."

crete_sale.4.t:0 "The Ottomans don't want Crete"
crete_sale.4.d:0 "The Ottomans have replied to our offer, flatly stating that they do not want Crete. What shall we do?"
crete_sale.4.a:0 "Keep Crete under our influence then."
crete_sale.4.b:0 "Offer it to Greece."

crete_sale.5.t:0 "The Sale of Crete"
crete_sale.5.d:0 "The Germans have come offering the sale of Crete. While it would obviously cost us a sizeable amount of money, having the island once more would greatly strengthen our position in the Mediterranean. What shall our reply be?"
crete_sale.5.a:0 "Welcome home, Crete"
crete_sale.5.b:0 "We do not need that rock."

crete_sale.6.t:0 "The Sale of Crete"
crete_sale.6.d:0 "The Greek Ambassador has sent a message to us, declaring that the Greek King has agreed to buy Crete. We have begun to transfer control of the Cretan State to them."
crete_sale.6.a:0 "Great!"

crete_sale.7.t:0 "The Greeks don't want Crete"
crete_sale.7.d:0 "The Greeks have replied to our offer, flatly stating that they do not want Crete. What shall we do?"
crete_sale.7.a:0 "Keep Crete under our influence then"
crete_sale.7.b:0 "Offer it to the Ottoman Empire."

crete_sale.8.t:0 "The Cretan State"
crete_sale.8.d:0 "With the transaction finalised with the Germans, the status of the Cretan state has come to the forefront of our agenda. As the Cretan State was originally created because of our weak grasp on the island, the majority of the ministers are pushing to just shuffling the government in Crete. However a few hawkish men are calling for direct annexation. What shall we do?"
crete_sale.8.a:0 "Install a new Cretan government."
crete_sale.8.b:0 "End its autonomy!"

crete_sale.9.t:0 "The Cretan State"
crete_sale.9.d:0 "With the transaction finalised with the Germans, the status of the Cretan state has come to the forefront of our agenda. As Crete was ours before we lost the Weltkrieg, the majority of the ministers are pushing to annex the Cretan state. However, a few men are calling for only an indirect subordination of Crete. What shall we do?"
crete_sale.9.a:0 "Install a new Cretan government."
crete_sale.9.b:0 "Hurrah for the second Enosis!"

crete_sale.10.t:0 "The Second Weltkrieg!"
crete_sale.10.d:0 "The Germans and French are once more at war! While we have duly joined the war against the Syndicalists, the 'Enosis' brotherhood have been gathering strength..."
crete_sale.10.a:0 "Good riddance!"
crete_sale.10.b:0 "The Enosis brotherhood coups the government!"

crete_sale.11.t:0 "Crete is Greek once more!"
crete_sale.11.d:0 "With the Germans embroiled in their war with the Syndicalists, our brothers in Crete took the chance to rise against the Germans!"
crete_sale.11.a:0 "Hurrah for the second Enosis!"
