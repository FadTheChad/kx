POLITICS_MOHAMMED_ALIM_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! January 3rd, 1880, in Bukhara, Emirate of Bukhara\n§YPolitical Career:§! Emir Sayyid Mir Muhammad Alim Khan is the last ruler of the royal title inherited from Genghis Khan's empire, the Bukhara Khanate. His reign, beginning in 1911, was promising at first - the emir introduced reforms in taxation and administration, and some thought he might be the reformer Bukhara needed to become an independent state again. However, it turned out that his reforms were only aimed at strengthening his power, and reformers who were in the khanate were expelled or repressed. With the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, Bukhara, like its khanate of Khiva, severed ties with the Soviet government and declared its independence. During the conflict they successfully repelled the Bolshevik attack, and helped the neighboring Provisional Government of Fergana finish off their remnants in Tashkent.\n\nAs time passed, the emir was increasingly influenced by the thoughts of Ibrahim Bey, a descendant of the lower strata of the Uzbek tribe who had risen rapidly in the Bukhara army during the Russian Civil War. A talented partisan, Ibrahim Bey was also a religious conservative opposed to the Jadid movement, and he appealed to the emir to create a unified, orthodox Islamic Central Asia. And the emir seems to sympathize with him."

POLITICS_IBRAHIM_BEK_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1889, in Koktash kishlak, Hissar Valley, Emirate of Bukhara\n§YPolitical Career:§! Muhammad Ibrahim-Bey, son of Chakobay, was born in the village of Koktash in the Hisar Valley and was the youngest son in the family. In this world, between the Bey's fortress and trading rows of Dushambe, in the shadow of the blue mountains, among the villages scattered across the valley and foothills, Ibrahim Bey spent his childhood and youth. Here he attended the Maktab in the Madrasah. He gained fame as a batyr here. Here he was a constant winner in horse races and wrestling.\n\nThis fame allowed him, already at a young age, to form a small band of young fellow villagers and become its kurbashi. However, after his father's death in 1912 he was also granted the official status of a tax collector. His roles as an adventurer and an emir's official were not particularly contradictory. \n\nHowever, it was not his native Bukhara that brought him fame, but his exploits abroad. The most combat-ready part, sent to Kokand to fight Bolshevism were Lokai detachments of Ibrahim Bey, roaming near Samarkand. He destroyed the detachments of invaders who traveled for food, attacked garrisons and seized weapons depots. As a result, his warriors were well armed and the tribal connection made Ibrahim Bey's detachments manageable and relatively disciplined. He had great personal authority and a reputation as a recklessly brave and incredibly successful jigit. Soon his words decided everything at the mujahedin's councils, and the mujahedin themselves began to enjoy the unconditional support of the population.\n\nSoon after the end of the war in Turkestan, Ibrahim Bey became bey of Hisar at the will of the Emir, and later he was awarded the honorary title of Atalyk for the first time since 1906."

### Events ###
bukhara.1.t: "The Stable Rule of Emir"
bukhara.1.d: "In 1917 the Russian Provisional Government recognized the independence of the Emirate of Bukhara. The revolutionary national-democratic movement of the Young Bukharans was suppressed, and Soviet intervention in Central Asia failed. Bukhara became one of the reactionary centers in Central Asia, where the White Guards fled, repressed dissenters, actively rearmed the army. However, fairly soon the civil war in Russia ended, and Bukhara was no longer threatened by external enemies ...\n\nIn the following years, the emirate was more than preoccupied with its own conflicts. The magnificent steppe all too often became a battlefield in which various factions and warlords killed each other. Yet even in the face of constant fighting, one man ruled the country with an iron fist. The year 1936 marks the 25th anniversary of Muhammad Alim Khan's rule in Bukhara, a rule that initially promised radical change and a bright new future - only for Khan to continue the status quo of Islamic nationalism by allying with the mujahedin movement. It would seem that even independence cannot bring change to Bukhara, as it still suffers from the illiteracy, corruption, and weakness that defined the region decades ago. Yet even now, as thousands of refugees try to flee its borders, there are still those who have not lost hope for modernization and entry into a glorious new era."
bukhara.1.a: "Serquyosh hur o'lkam!"

bukhara.2.t: "Russians Withdraw the Capital"
bukhara.2.d: "With the Russian economy descending into chaos and Petrograd exchange closed for a few days, the Russian settlers and capitalists start to withdraw their capital from Bukharan prosperous oasis. The situation is further exacerbated by the rejection of imports from our neighbors and the sharp decline in trade and tax revenues. Trying to sell at a favorable price, entrepreneurs have sharply increased the prices of their products. Legitimately, our ministers called for an immediate price reduction. It is necessary to take the situation under personal control before it is too late."
bukhara.2.a: "Tragedy!"

bukhara.3.t: "Status of the Zakot"
bukhara.3.d: "Zakot, one of the five fillars of Islam, was levied on goods entering and leaving the Emirate for endless years. What is more important, the Russians had better conditions and lower Zakot to pay. As our Karaul-Begi has put it, this situation is an unprecented gesture of goodwill, which should be a subject to change. However, Nizomiddin Urganji, our Kushbegi, suggests that we should not be so hard on the Russians, since they invested much into our country. Nevertheless, the general Zakot duty will be raised for all commodities, but the question whether the Russians goods should be treated as any other is still unsolved."
bukhara.3.a: "Kushbegi is right, we should not anger the Russians..."
bukhara.3.b: "The Russian dominance should be over, treat them equally!"

bukhara.4.t: "Bukharan Emirate Raises Zakot"
bukhara.4.d: "With the economic crisis raging on, the economy of Bukhara, heavily dependent on us, is struggling. Today we received information from our ambassador in Bukhara, that the Emirate has raised the Zakot, or Zyaket, on all commodities, including the Russian ones. We would have easily understood their situation right now, if not the circumstances. Negotiated previously, even in Imperial times, the Russians got a lowered duty to pay, because of the agreements between Emirate and us. With the new rules applied by the Emir, the Russians now have to pay the equal amount as other merchants, which is definetely causes unrest from the Russian-owned business in Bukhara. With our hegemony over Bukharan economy now at question, we must reconsider our relations with the Emirate."
bukhara.4.a: "This situation is unprecented! Threaten Bukhara with embargo!"
bukhara.4.b: "We should not risk our relations at this point."

bukhara.5.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Benefits!"
bukhara.5.d: "With Russian government receiving the note about changes of Zakot, their ministers have bursted out in anger, claiming that we have violated the agreements. In addition to the unrest, caused by the Russian entrepreneurs here, the Hegemon demands restoration of the old rules and agreements about Zakot on Russian commodities. The issue has caused a great deal of problem in the Palace, as well, as once again we have to take a side and decide if we should finally get rid of Russian influence."
bukhara.5.a: "We won't revert any changes!"
bukhara.5.b: "We can't risk our vital ties with Russia."

bukhara.6.t: "Bukhara Refused!"
bukhara.6.d: "The Bukharan Council of Ministers has officially denied our kind and definetely not ultimative demand. With our barter and exchange now in question, the ministers demand to immidiately enact restrictions on Bukhara!"
bukhara.6.a: "Who they think they are?!"

bukhara.7.t: "Bukhara Restores Benefits"
bukhara.7.d: "The Bukharan Emirate has restored the previous benefits for Russian goods and commodities. With our mechants and entrepreneurs happy, we can finally put an end to this crisis."
bukhara.7.a: "Glad they have some sense!"

bukhara.8.t: "Russian Embargo"
bukhara.8.d: "The Russians have embargoed us as a response to making their Zakot equal to other traders. Well, no matter what they do now, they should respect us and stop viewing us as their colony we once were!"
bukhara.8.a: "We will be better even without them!"

bukhara.9.t: "Status of Russian-Owned Industry"
bukhara.9.d: "The Russian control the majority of industry, railroads and mines in Bukhara, despite that is not their country. As the Karaul-Begi has stated, every single factory or business in Bukhara shall not only belong to all Bukharan people, but as well be owned by them. With our ties with Russia at a verge of collapse, it would be quite prudent to nationalize Russian production, or better yet, to simply expropriate it."
bukhara.9.a: "Expropriate Russian industry."
bukhara.9.b: "Just increase taxes for them even more."

bukhara.10.t: "Filling the Coffers"
bukhara.10.d: "For the first time since the Civil War, our treasury is facing a sudden emptiness and needs urgent replenishment. However, circumstances are such that it is almost impossible to find finances now, unless one takes this money from the beneficiaries of our economy. The most obvious option here would be to tax foreigners, first and foremost Russian businesses. Kushbegi, for his part, proposes taxing the elites, promising them the temporary nature of such measures. After all, if the Emir does not want to offend anyone, he can invest the treasury himself out of his own pocket."
bukhara.10.a: "Our elites will pay."
bukhara.10.b: "Emir shall share his own wealth."
bukhara.10.c: "The Russians will pay."

bukhara.11.t: "Ethnic Tensions"
bukhara.11.d: "According to the ethnographic composition, the population of the Bukhara Khanate is divided into two parts, of which the first belonged to the peoples of the Turkic generation, and the second to the peoples of the Iranian generation. Between the Turkic peoples in the first place are the Uzbeks, the dominant people in whose hands power is concentrated. The Uzbeks are divided into clans, living in different parts of the Khanate, and clan origin plays a significant role in their life. The Turkic nationalities also include Turkmens, who are divided into several clans.\nIn addition to the above-mentioned main nationalities of Bukhara Khanate, a small number of Jews, Afghans, Persians, Arabs, Roma, Armenians, and others live in it. The Arabs roam near Wardanzi and are engaged in cattle-raising. The Jews live in the towns and are engaged in crafts and trade, and the Hindus in trade and usury.\n\nIn general, the population of Bukhara khanate consists of very different, hostile elements, the connecting link of which is, to some extent, religion. Almost the entire population of the khanate professes Islam, and the Turkic nationalities are exclusively Sunni Muslims, while the Iranian ones, outwardly recognizing the Sunnah, in reality remain ardent Shiites."
bukhara.11.a: "We should reconsider our position towards minorities."

bukhara.12.t: "25th Anniversary of Emir’s Rule"
bukhara.12.d: "Soon Bukhara and a number of other major cities in the Emirate will host celebrations to mark the 25th anniversary of Alim Khan's rule. In the cities are expected festivities and festive bazaars, during which dekhkans will be able to honor the power and majesty of the \"Garden of the Universe\", the majestic Bukhara and its Emir, who brought peace and prosperity to these lands."
bukhara.12.a: "We hope that the festivities will go off without a hitch"

bukhara.13.t: "Unrest in Bukhara"
bukhara.13.d: "Today, Emir's 25th birthday, started off rather celebratory. A feast table was laid for Emir and his distinguished guests, and nothing in the Emirate’s capital foretold trouble. Soon, however, near sunset, according to witnesses' reports, a number of opposition politicians arrived in the city from the direction of Qagan and began to anger the masses. The dominance of Russian capitalism, the monstrous corruption of officials, and the gluttony of the Emir's palace were declared by them to be a feast during the Plague. Already soon their speeches were supported by the poorest segments of the population, who began smashing up stores and markets and shouting slogans for reform.\n\nOn hearing the news, Alim Khan ordered the immediate dispatch of the garrison to Bukhara and the restoration of order in the streets, but it was too late. The city was ablaze with unrest, and the jadids who had been enraging the people were gone. The restless crowd did not want to be pacified and demanded that the Emir should come to them in person. The garrison could not forgive such impudence, and armed clashes broke out as a result, with a number of fatalities and casualties. Bloodshed on a feast day in the holy city. \n\nReformers from among those close to the Emir asked him to listen to the demands of the demonstrators and promise to carry out at least some very moderate reforms. Otherwise, more bloodshed could not be avoided."
bukhara.13.a: "The manifestation is drowned in blood..."
bukhara.13.b: "Emir issues the Majestic Ordinance of Reform..."

bukhara.14.t: "Atalyk"
bukhara.14.d: "Atalyk of Bukhara or Great Ataiyk is a title corresponding to the title of vizier and high dignitary, traditionally given to especially honorable and respected persons. In 1887 Astanakul-Bey-biy received the highest rank of atalyk, which he carried with honor and dignity until his death in 1906. In the last Bukhara emirs, no one in the emirate had such a rank.\n\nHowever, times are changing. On the verge of chaos, Bukhara seems to need the return of the title of Atalyk, the person who will lead Bukhara into the future and set it on the right path. Although, as some reformers claim, the tradition does not need a return."
bukhara.14.a: "The glorious Mujahid Ibrahim Bey"
bukhara.14.b: "Kushbegi shall be granted a title of Atalyk."
bukhara.14.c: "We should not restore a good old tradition."

bukhara.15.t: "Violence in Bukhara!"
bukhara.15.d: "There is chaos in the streets of Bukhara! Following the Emir’s refusal to accept Young Bukhara’s ultimatum, the radicals kept their promises to bring “consequences”, which has taken the form of a massive protest in the city. The police struggled to keep the protesters back as they advanced towards the Sitora-i Mokhi Khosa, shouting demands for the Emir to abdicate. The Emir has not yet budged, and still has a force of guards ready to disperse the crowd, by force if necessary. As night broke over noble Bukhara, the opposition's leaders sent a messenger to Alim Khan, giving the Emir one last chance to abdicate and be spared before the march on the palace began..."
bukhara.15.a: "Emir flees to Hissar, leaving the capital in protesters' hands"
bukhara.15.b: "The messenger's head is returned to the protesters. The Battle for Bukhara has begun."

bukhara.16.t: "Mecca of Central Asia"
bukhara.16.d: "With the representation of Bukhara as Mecca of Central Asia, thousands of Muslim pilgrims are welcomed in our Garden of the Universe. With a restless flood of people arriving in the Emirate, our coffers are filling with money and Bukhara is slowly recovering from the recent economic turmoils."
bukhara.16.a: "We welcome our Muslim brothers to Bukhara"

bukhara.17.t: "Violence in Bukhara!"
bukhara.17.d: "Bukharan tenga"
bukhara.17.a: "Urgent measures are needed."

bukhara.18.t: "Honouring Shlomo Musaev"
bukhara.18.d: ""
bukhara.18.a: "The Bukharan Jews are our people, even if of different faith."
bukhara.18.b: "The equality of our peoples is of primary meaning."

bukhara.19.t: "Russian Residency"
bukhara.19.d: "Initially founded in 1885 to represent the political and economic interests of Russia in Bukhara, the Political Agency by its name was supposed to show the Emir of Bukhara that in the eyes of the Empire he was above the vassal, but below the independent ruler, because the political agency was more than a general consulate, but it was not an embassy in a sovereign state. The political agent was an official representative of the Russian Empire and was in constant communication with the Kushbegi.\n\nHowever, the political agency gradually turned into an institution, which carried out only colonization measures in relation to the emirate. After the February Revolution, the name was changed to the Russian Residency. Political agent Alexander Miller in March 1917 became the initiator and leader of the project of reforms in the Bukhara Emirate, not violating the status of its political autonomy, but as a result of the suppression of the Young Bukhara in April, he was removed from office. Bukhara was rapidly moving toward independence and the termination of the Residency was a matter of time.\n\nHowever, already in 1921, as a result of the Hissar Accords, relations between the new Russia and Bukhara were restored. One of the conditions of the agreement was the restoration of the Residency, and Sergei Chirkin became the new political agent. The influence of the Residency is far from what it was before 1917, but all communications still go through it, as do issues of an economic nature. "

bukhara.20.t: "Fate of the Russian Residency"
bukhara.20.d: "Along with the irreversible extinction of Russian rule over Bukhara, the existence of the Russian Residency, or Russian Political Agency, came under great question.\n\nBy eliminating this hateful imprint of the past, we would jeopardize all Russian-Bukharian relations, which is likely to lead to a complete severance of ties with Russia, and even a possible military escalation, so for some Russophiles among the ministers this issue is quite acute. On the other hand, by destroying this unnecessary attribute of the past, we will only strengthen our intentions and establish ourselves as a sovereign state."

bukhara.23.d: "Ibrahim Bey, the great dzhigit who liberated Samarkand from the Bolshevik monsters and thereby earned himself a place at court. But what did he do for Bukhara itself? His warriors, the Lokai from Hissar, are the most experienced and reckless fighters of the Bukhara army, but the ambitions of Ibrahim Bey himself, who became Karaul-begi and claims to be Atalyk or Kushbegi, are at least incomprehensible.\n\nThe Emir is under the influence of Ibrahim Bey, but this must be stopped. The reformist wing could lobby for the appointment to the Council of Eshon Babahan ibn Abdulmahijan, a prominent preacher, scholar of theology and jurisprudence. More importantly, he is a supporter of Jadidism, and his influence could be significant on the state of affairs in the Council"
bukhara.23.a: "Appoint Eshon Babakhan to the Council."
bukhara.23.b: "The position of Ibrahim Bey is secured."

bukhara.24.t: "Tajik-Uzbek Tensions"
bukhara.24.d: "Located at the crossroads of important trade routes, Bukhara became a country with a rich cultural mix, mostly Persian, Uzbek, and Jewish. Ethnic tensions here are quite strong, especially between the Shiite and Sunni populations. Religious intolerance had already led to riots and clashes, as in 1910, when a thousand people were killed in the capital. \n\nBukhara is now a city with a predominantly Tajik population, despite the predominance of Uzbeks. But things are much worse in eastern Bukhara, in the western Pamirs and Hissar, where Uzbeks and Tajiks have lived side by side for centuries, and the tribal strife has hardly ceased. According to the Reformists, this situation needs to be rectified immediately and Islamic unity must prevail."
bukhara.24.a: "Minorities should be protected."

bukhara.25.t: "Muslim Unity"
bukhara.25.d: "Muslim brothers should not live in discord, strife, and constant enmity. In our unity is strength, and for our multinational emirate this should be the natural conclusion of all inter-ethnic and religious discord.\n\nBy the Greatest decree of the Emirate, the protection of the population of every confession and ethnicity has become a fact. Now the courts must side with the victim, regardless of his denomination. By achieving internal stability and getting rid of ethnic tensions, we will open the way to the future for Bukhara and its people."

bukhara.29.d: "The Emirate is divided into 17 Bekliks, in which either relatives of the Emir or persons enjoying his special trust sat as Beks. Until the last quarter of the 19th century, the Emirate even had autonomous Shahdoms, such as Karategin and Darwaz.\n\nTraditionally, the Bekliks were quite free, although they did not deviate much from the Emir's policy. However, at the insistence of Kushbegi Nizomiddin Urganji, the Emirate needed to centralize power around the Emir and the Council of Ministers. However, many in the Council did not agree with centralization. Thus, Karaul-begi Ibrahim Bey, who is known to come from the Lokai tribe of Hissar, stated that centralization would harm the traditional tenets of Bukhara, in particular putting the Mahalla communities at risk, and increase the burden on the bureaucracy, which already needs decentralization."
bukhara.29.a: "We should attempt to centralize the Emirate."
bukhara.29.b: "Reject, it will only make our situation worse."

bukhara.30.t: "The New Kushbegi"
bukhara.30.d: "The time has come for our mighty Emir to appoint a new Kushbegi for the Emirate. From two main candidates, Ibrahim-Bey has recently increased his influence in the Court, but whether it will be enough to become 'heir apparent' to the Vizier position is unknown. His main opponent and current Kushbegi, Nizomiddin Urganji took root in his chair long ago."

bukhara.32.d: "In the aftermath of the fall of the Emir and his puppeteers, the former rulers of Bukhara, have been rather quiet...perhaps too quiet. These former rulers are mainly made up of the leadership of the Mujahideen movement, and it is unclear what they are planning next. In the past few weeks, sightings of Mujahideen activity were reported around the border with Afghanistan. Now, that activity has culminated in an insurgency. The Mujahideen leaders have announced to the world the creation of a new Islamic Federation “destined to retake noble Bukhara in the name of Islam.” Acting fast, our leaders have already begun to ready their forces for an offensive to wipe out these fundamentalists. However, with the insurgency centered in the treacherous Pamir Mountains, eliminating the Islamic Federation may not be so easy. Some argue that it would be better to lure them out into more open ground, and eliminate them that way. Either way, a choice must be made to deal with the resurgent reactionaries before they get too threatening."

bukhara.34.d: "As expected, the mountainous area of Pamir aided the Mujahideen forces to great effect in their desperate defence. As our forces took more and more casualties assaulting those rugged hills, we were forced to make a hasty retreat with our few remaining troops, all limping bruised and scarred back to camp. The Mujahideen have earned themselves a decisive victory in the battle, further consolidating their power in Pamir. We must be careful and remain smart if we are to maintain our revolt’s steam."
bukhara.34.a: "It's unlikely they will ambush us, rest easy and lick your wounds."
bukhara.34.b: "We can bandage our wounds on the march! Protect Karshi in case they try to surround us."

bukhara.35.t: "Mujahideen Re-Captured Karshi"
bukhara.35.d: "The Mujahideen have long instigated unrest in the city and as their forces approached the main gates of the city, a militia army sprang to life from within Karshi’s walls, surrounding us as we rested. However, this has also left their flank exposed and, if quick, we can cut into the rear now, capturing Pamir and leaving the enemy’s forces to rot in Karshi, where we can easily crush them. Shall we try to seize a city in chaos, or strike their exposed guard and drive their armies into the desert wastes?"

Now, it will be easy for us to crush them in Karshi, hopefully ending their influence in our region once and for all. However, maybe we should shore up the defenses at Bukhara, in case they decide to capture our capital as we revel in the joys of our recent win."

The majority of the area had been under influence of Westernization and Jadidists, who still carry out their deeds and missions underground and out of sight throughout the region. Most of them were rural proletariat and bandits in Emir’s eyes. With our repressions against Jadidists, they had renewed their propaganda on dehkans, merchants and proletariat.\n\nUnfortunately, the hotbed of liberal evil turned out to be too cruel. As the royal motorcade with Emir passed through the main street of the city, there was an explosion...\n\nSeconds later, after a rather powerful blast, the citizens were faced with a terrible sight. A burnt-out motorcade, broken windows, and Emir... lying in a pool of his own blood. Before anyone had time to regain their senses, the dehqan, armed with sabers, ran out of the crowd and carried out a lynching of the badly wounded Emir. The carnage began when the Mujahideen swooped in on the terrorists. This day will go down in history forever - instead of his murdered father his successor immediately ascended the throne of Bukhara, the Crown Prince Shahmurad Alim Khan"

On the other side of the Panj and Amu Darya, lies the Bukharan State, which, according to our intelligence, has recently kicked all the Russian capitalists out, nationalizing their resources and cutting ties with the Bear in the North. \n\nIn 1918 a British military mission was sent to the Trans-Caspian region with the task of organizing resistance to the expected German-Turkish offensive after the fall of Baku. On August 19, 1918, a formal agreement was concluded with the Trans-Caspian Provisional Government, which helped in the organization of the armed forces, the so-called Turkestan Army. Shortly thereafter, the mission moved to Ashkhabad, where it remained until the beginning of the Afghan war. However, the mission soon had to be terminated. The mission was commanded by Major General Wilfrid Malleson, head of British intelligence in India, retired since 1920.\n\nNow, the retired general appealed directly to the King and the House of Princes to lead a new mission to Turkestan, to troubled Bukhara, where revolutionary events were brewing to take control of the country. Despite his offer, a final decision had not yet been made, for the Canadian government was now concentrating on preparations for a landing in the British Isles, and to compete with Russia for power over the region might not be in the interests of the Crown and the Empire."

Despite his growing ambitions, he's still a men of the people, most importantly, the local people of Hissar - the Lokai tribes. As the great law of politics say - Divide and Conquer, and this is the strategy we should attach to.\n\nAs the Viceroy suggests, we should establish a fiefdom for Ibrahim Bey to rule as long as he and his Mujahideen stay loyal to us.

The basis of the parliamentary system would be a 56-member Legislative Assembly. Elections to local governments would be by curiae, depending on religious or ethnic affiliation.\n\nAlthough the Bukhara Government Act provoked much discontent, particularly among liberals who criticized it for being insufficiently representative, one party, the Milliy Ittihod, is expected to take over the next parliamentary elections, with the majority of seats going to nonpartisan pro-British candidates from the Viceroy's mandate list."

The Vizier of the Khivan Khanate has been one of the Emir’s closest friends in the past, and so the contents of the letter are no surprise. What is a surprise to the Emir, however, is that the Vizier was able to send a letter in the first place. With rumors and gossip about Junaid Khan’s illness as of late, it is undoubtedly a relief to be given proof that his old friend is well enough to continue correspondence.

Little did he know, the Serdar-Karim’s letter to the Emir would be his last. There may be little time for the distraught Khan to mourn his friend, however.

However, the Vizier, Ibrahim Bey, and Mujahideen have fervently protested against any negotiation with the “radical modernists.” Early into his reign, the Emir was indeed a supporter of the reformists, but ever since realizing he would have no place in their Bukhara, he has been very weary of negotiation. With the recent turn of events, inaction is no longer an option, for Young Bukhara is simply too strong to ignore.

The police struggled to keep the protesters back as they advanced towards the Sitora-i Mokhi Khosa, shouting demands for the Emir to abdicate. The Emir has not yet budged, and still has a force of guards ready to disperse the crowd, by force if necessary.

The palace was breached, and the Emir only barely escaped with his life, tearfully looking back at the city one last time before his departure.

Finally, upon the Emir's command, the guards and police began their counterattack, driving the rabble further and further into the city's outskirts and capturing several leaders. As noble Bukhara finally settled down, the Emir emerged from the palace to proclaim a new dawn for Bukhara. It would be a day of peace and prosperity, free from the chaos that Young Bukhara almost brought to the Emirate."
buh.8.a: "It's just another day in Bukhara."



buh.21.t: "Mujahideen Victory in Khiva"
buh.21.d: "The Mujahideen reaffirmed their power in Khiva with Sayid Abdullah consolidating his rule as an absolute monarch. This issue however is worrying, as it means that the Young Khiva party will be actively suppressed and most of its members shall join the Young Bukhara Party. We can make an alliance with them to prevent bloodshed, or strengthen Mujahideen support in our region."
buh.21.a: "Reach out in the name of cooperation."
buh.21.b: "Instead, let us strengthen our own position."

buh.22.t: "First Bukharan Elections"

buh.26.t: "Young Bukhara Activity Intensifies"
buh.26.d: "The next elections will be held soon in the neighboring Kokand Republic, and in this regard, the activity of the Young Bukharans has noticeably increased. Unlike Junaid Khan, the Emir never suppressed the movement so much, seeing some advantages in the educational activities of the Jadidists. However, the power of the Emir was still strong due to the bayonets of the Mujahideen. Now a new era has come, and it is possible that the only opportunity for the emirate to finally modernize is to change the government, resigning Kashbegi, and appointing a representative of the Young Bukharian as the new Vizier."
buh.26.a: "The winds of change are blowing."
buh.26.b: "The Emirate is not yet ready."

buh.27.t: "Young Bukharans-Revolutionaries Call for Nationalization"
buh.27.d: "With the Young Bukharans finally throwing off the shackles of medieval emirate, more radical reforms should be implemented, as believed by the socialist wing of the Yosh Buxoroliklar party.\n\nThe left wing is as well divided into radicals and moderates, with the first being led by Fayzulla Hojaev, a pro-Russian socialist, and the second being led by Usmon Hoja, independent Turkestan enthusiast.\n\nThey both see our rule now as reactionary and believe that Jadidism should evolve into something more then a bourgeouis-capitalist phenomenon. The Young Bukharans-Revolutionaries insist we should as soon as possible move to the councilism and elect the Council of People's Nazir instead of the current Mejlis, but, however, it is unknown if Mirzo Munzim would give up his power."
buh.27.a: "Let us solve its peacefully. Hoja deserves to become our leader."
buh.27.b: "No way."

### Decisions ###
UZB_Vazirlar_Kengashi: "Vazirlar Kengashi"
UZB_Vazirlar_Kengashi_desc: "The §gCouncil of Ministers§! of the Bukhara Emirate are the people closest to the emir. These are the people who determine policy within the state. The key role in the Council is played by §YKushbegi§! - actually the Vizier, or Prime Minister of the state, but all the fullness of power still belongs to the Emir.\n\nAll the persons on the Council are unconditional supporters of the Emir, the monarchy, and all the pillars that have held Bukhara together for the past centuries. However, even in such a homogeneous environment, there are currents. The first of these is represented by the Kushbegi, §PNizomiddin Urganji§!. It is a Russophile current that seeks to centralize the Emirate, to hold on to the Emir’s absolute power, in other words, the status quo. The second is the rather young Mujahideen movement, which arose out of the popularity of Karaul-Begi, §FIbrahim Bey§!. They strive for the complete sovereignty of Bukhara from the Russian influence, and are intoxicated with the ideas of modernization of Bukhara through decentralization and unification of the tribes. The third, the smallest and most ostracized current is the §sReformists§!. Despite the brutal repression of the §lJadidists§! and their shift to predominantly republican positions, there are still a number of devoted supporters of constitutional monarchy among the Emir's retinue. They are the necessary balancing element that prevents the total defeat of Jadidism, and who hope, in incremental steps, to sway the entire §gCouncil§! to their side.\n\nTo tell the truth, the §gCouncil of Ministers§! is not quite effective, it is mired in conceit and corruption, and the soonest renewal of it is felt not only among the reformists, but even by Ibrahim Bey.[CheckBukharaKushbegiInfluence][CheckBukharaKaraulbegiInfluence][CheckBukharaReformistInfluence]"

### Ideas ###
TRK_nomadic_society: "Nomadic Legacy"
TRK_nomadic_society_desc: "Our society is traditionally rather nomadic, consisting of wandering tribes migrating with their herds of cattle. However, over the past century, Russians have built large cities, laid railroads, and settled many foreigners on our land, completely changing our way of life. Now the question before us is whether we should adapt to an industrial, sedentary age or try to stay true to our nomadic roots."

UZB_russian_economic_hegemony: "Lingering Hegemony"
UZB_russian_economic_hegemony_desc: "While the Russian Republic recognizes Bukhara's independence, our old hegemon still wields significant sway over our politics and economy. Russian capital and machinery have brought technological advancements, such as railroads, gold mines and cotton plantations, yet the lion's share of profits flows back to Russian owners, leaving us with a meager portion derived from our own lands and resources."
UZB_stagnant_government_bureaucracy: "Bureaucratic Stalemate"
UZB_stagnant_government_bureaucracy_desc: "Tensions brew among the emirate's government branches. Emir Alim Khan's direct interference and favoritism towards loyalists have paralyzed the once-efficient state machinery. The feud between Kushbegi Nizomiddin Urganji and Karaulbegi Ibrahim Bey threatens bureaucratic collapse. Reformists fear a complete breakdown, while conservatives criticize the system as weakened and fractured by reform attempts."
UZB_antiquated_army: "Dilapidated Military"
UZB_antiquated_army_desc: "Despite Emir Alim Khan's education at Russian military academies and assistance from Russian advisors, our efforts to modernize the Bukhara army face continuous challenges with limited success. Much of our fighting force remains a tribal levy drafted in crises, slow to adapt to modern equipment and tactics. Urgent reforms are needed to avoid vulnerability in potential conflicts."
UZB_wind_of_changes: "Wind of Changes"
UZB_wind_of_changes_desc: "The 25th anniversary of Emir's rule was overshadowed by mass demonstrations initiated by Young Baharans and riots in the capital. Instead of the promised popular festivities and lavish treats, people received scandal and violence. Reformers among those close to the emir persuaded Alim Khan to announce reforms, a decree that became known as the January Promises, which spoke of rapid reforms in the emirate. As long as the January Promises are valid and their memory is fresh, any action we take to strengthen the Emir's power will provoke a violent reaction."
