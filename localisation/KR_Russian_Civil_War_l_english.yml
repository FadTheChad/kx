### Events ###
rcw.1.t:0 "Goodbye, Old Lavr"
rcw.1.d:0 "Today, by presidential decree, the supreme commander of the Russian army, an outstanding figure of the white movement, Lavr Kornilov, was dismissed.\n\nKornilov reacted quite sharply to his resignation. Fearing Kornilov's uprising, we can quietly remove him... or leave it alone. Perhaps a compromise option would be to settle him in a state dacha and give certain guarantees, but it is unlikely that Kornilov will silently agree to this..."
rcw.1.a:0 "Let the Cheka remove him silently..."
rcw.1.b:0 "Try to remove him silently..."
rcw.1.e:0 "Ignore him."

rcw.2.t:0 "Sudden Death of General Kornilov"
rcw.2.d:0 "Suddenly, news came about the sudden death of Genaral Kornilov, which immediately attracted media attention due to his recent resignation and the appointment of the pro-government head of the Army. As reported, General Kornilov died as a result of a massive heart attack, in his home, late at night. However, according to eyewitnesses, there was a fuss in the apartment, and a black car of the Nizhny Novgorod plant was standing under the windows.\n\nThe very next day after the news, a fairly large rally gathered in Moscow demanding an investigation into the General's death, and many prominent officers made the same demands. On the one hand, we can officially recognize the death as natural, but we will lose the support of people and only raise even greater doubts. On the other hand, we can falsify the investigation and come to the same result, which will satisfy the needs of the protesters."
rcw.2.a:0 "Well, he was rather old..."
rcw.2.b:0 "Investigation Will Be Held"

rcw.3.t:0 "Kornilov's Death"
rcw.3.d:0 "Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov, Supreme Commander-in-chief, one of the four officers that led the White Movement against the Bolsheviks during the civil war, passed away last night at his dacha outside Petrograd at the age of 68.  Kornilov has greatly contributed to post-revolutionary Russia's politics. Two weeks of national mourning have been declared as the people prepare for the funeral ceremony."
rcw.3.a:0 "The great helmsman of the Russian nation is no more." 

rcw.4.t:0 "Kornilov Raises An Uprising"
rcw.4.d:0 "Ignoring Kornilov, we were faced with the fact that he managed to get out of the capital and go to the South of Russia, where he began to convene a rather conservative electorate to defend the Motherland from the socialists. Thus, creating essentially a second Volunteer army. He was joined in the majority by other generals who declared loyalty to the former regime and the impossibility of serving the socialist minority. It seems that the situation is heating up and we need to take urgent measures..."
rcw.4.a:0 "That's enough. The government retires."
rcw.4.b:0 "Call for the loyal forces and demand Kornilov's surrender."
rcw.4.c:0 "We shall act more decisively. Proclaim the RSR!"

rcw.5.t:0 "New Elections"
rcw.5.d:0 "The government decided to resign, having lost most of the popular support and now humiliated and almost destroyed. The next election will be held in two months. Critics will say that the ruling party betrayed the masses, but, as the party leaders say, this was done in the name of national stability and in order to avoid war. The generals returned to Headquarters, disbanding the volunteer army."
rcw.5.a:0 "Victory or Loss? That is the question."

rcw.6.t:0 "Kornilov Ignores the Ultimatum!"
rcw.6.d:0 "General Kornilov has ignored the ultimatum we sent and escaped to Volgograd, where he started to build up defences and call for the Second Volunteer Army to fight against us. Well, he made his choice, now he will regret it."
rcw.6.a:0 "Onwards!"
rcw.6.b:0 "Fight for Holy Russia! (Play as Kornilov's Russia)"

rcw.7.t:0 "The Proclamation of Russian Socialist Republic"
rcw.7.d:0 "The Old Republic is gone. Now only the socialists will decide fate of proletarian masses. The wild Generals, led by Kornilov have decided to play their own game, let us see how they will react now."
rcw.7.a:0 "Onwards!"
rcw.7.b:0 "Fight for Holy Russia! (Play as Kornilov's Russia)"

rcw.8.t:0 "Test the Peasant Marshal"
rcw.8.d:0 "Anton Denikin, nicknamed the Peasant Marshal, actually has nothing in common with the peasants and the proletariat. He conducted one of the most successful campaigns against the Reds during the Civil War, so he definitely should not be trusted. At the same time, his authority is quite high, and perhaps keeping him as head of the General Staff at least for the moment will help us gain time and calm the situation in the army."
rcw.8.a:0 "Let the Cheka remove him silently..."
rcw.8.b:0 "Try to remove him silently..."
rcw.8.c:0 "Leave him be for now."
rcw.8.e:0 "Have him retire."

rcw.9.t:0 "Anton Denikin Dies"
rcw.9.d:0 "A Hero of the Civil War and the informal leader of Russian conservatives, Anton Ivanovich Denikin, died yesterday in his manor. Although never as radical as his counterpart, Baron Wrangel, Denikin's influence throughout Russia was hard to overestimate. A week of national mourning has been declared as the people bade farewell to one of the few true Heroes of Russia."
rcw.9.a:0 "Even the strongest die one day!"

rcw.10.t:0 "Sudden Death of General Denikin"
rcw.10.d:0 "Today, our country has received the terrible news about the sudden death of one of the best sons of the Fatherland, General Denikin. With the coming to power of the Socialist Party, relations between Denikin, as well as other conservative generals, and the government deteriorated significantly. Denikin's sudden death aroused suspicions even among some supporters of the current government, let alone the opposition-minded electorate. Baron Wrangel, one of the closest associates of Kornilov and Denikin, claimed that the murder was covered up by the government and demanded that the government immediately resign and transfer power into the hands of the provisional government, which he will lead."
rcw.10.a:0 "Give in his demands."
rcw.10.b:0 "Who he is to dictate us?"

rcw.11.t:0 "Wrangel Raises An Uprising"
rcw.11.d:0 "Baron Wrangel went to Volgograd, where he was able to raise the conservative-minded population and some generals to declare the creation of a Government of National Salvation. Having accused the current government of dealing with high-ranking generals, he is serious and we need to fight back against him."
rcw.11.a:0 "Onwards!"
rcw.11.b:0 "Fight for Holy Russia! (Play as Government of National Salvation)"

rcw.12.t:0 "Provisional Military Government"
rcw.12.d:0 "The socialist government was humiliated and agreed to transfer power into the hands of a strong leader, Baron Wrangel. Having headed the provisional government, Wrangel can be sure that now any decision depends on his will."
rcw.12.a:0 "Call for elections in two months."
rcw.12.b:0 "Restore the Romanovs."
rcw.12.c:0 "Found a new royal dynasty."

rcw.13.t:0 "The Retirement of Denikin"
rcw.13.d:0 "Today, the head of the General Staff, Anton Denikin, was dismissed, and a promising pro-socialist general, Alexander Vasilevsky, took his chair. His views have long been the subject of rumors, but now they have been confirmed. Vasilevsky is respected among the generals, and therefore Denikin's resignation was not taken so seriously. Nevertheless, the former head of the General Staff himself announced an attempt to seize power, and no matter how paradoxical it may sound, he said that he intends to lead a popular uprising against the government. His statements violate the laws of our country and we should have arrested him to avoid trouble."
rcw.13.a:0 "Immediately arrest him!"
rcw.13.b:0 "Ignore him."
rcw.13.c:0 "Cheka will deal with him."

rcw.14.t:0 "Denikin Raises An Uprising"
rcw.14.d:0 "Anton Denikin went to Volgograd, where he was able to raise the conservative-minded poulation and some generals to declare the creation of the Second Armed Forces of South Russia. Having accused the current government of trying to establish socialism across Russia, he is serious and we need to fight back against him."
rcw.14.a:0 "Ownards!"
rcw.14.b:0 "Fight for Holy Russia! (Play as South Russia)"

rcw.15.t:0 "White Army. Black Baron"
rcw.15.d:0 "Although formally Baron Wrangel did not hold public posts, he was the vice-president of the ROVS under Kornilov, and after his departure became the head. His activities can be dangerous, and therefore the government proposes to send him to retirement and dissolve the ROVS, as a prohibited military organization, unnecessary in peacetime. A less popular solution would be to leave everything as it is, assuming that there is no threat from Wrangel."
rcw.15.a:0 "Dismantle the ROVS."
rcw.15.b:0 "Ignore him."

rcw.16.t:0 "Calming Down the Army"
rcw.16.d:0 "Now that all the main opponents among the general staff have been eliminated, it seems that we have managed to solve one of the main problems. At the same time, many officers are still rebelling, and we should solve this problem. The following options are available to us to resolve the crisis: to open criminal cases for desertion against those who refuse to follow orders; to raise the salaries of officers and soldiers, hoping that this will bribe them."
rcw.16.a:0 "We shall deal with them as with deserters."
rcw.16.b:0 "Rise up salaries for them."

rcw.17.t:0 "The End of Army Mutiny"
rcw.17.d:0 "We were able to cope with the unrest in the army and our armed forces are slowly starting to return to normal. This is a big victory for the government, and the leading party has dramatically increased its popularity among the population. Despite the fact that the army still does not trust us, at least they have stopped rebelling."
rcw.17.a:0 "Great!"

rcw.18.t:0 "Kornilov Surrenders"
rcw.18.d:0 "Kornilov, to our great happiness, agreed to surrender and submit to the demand of our ultimatum. The general was soon arrested and will soon be tried for attempting to organize a military coup. His stupid act allowed us to accuse the counter-revolutionary and conservative army elite of trying to usurp power and trying to overthrow the legally elected people's government, thus significantly expanding the repressive actions against the generals. The popular support was on our side.\n\nIn addition to General Kornilov, Denikin, Wrangel, Drozdovsky, and Markov, as well as all other generals connected with them in any way, were also purged. All of them were dismissed from their posts, or from the General Staff and arrested.\n\nDespite the fact that many talented generals were subjected to repression, our government is no longer in danger."
rcw.18.a:0 "Victory of the working people!"

rcw.26.t:0 "Pro-German Revolt in Pskov"
rcw.26.d:0 "General Bermondt-Avalov and his revived Western Russian Army has revolted in Pskov. We know about Bermondt-Avalov's pro-German views, so our General Staff wonders if we should outright declare war on them or try to sign a non-aggression treaty for now and deal with them later."

rcw.35.t:0 "Panic In Siberia!"
rcw.35.d:0 "Due to instability in the Western regions of Russia, local Siberian authorities finally had enough courage to proclaim Independent Siberia.

### Zhukov Coup New Events ###

rcw.200.t:0 "Workers' Strike in Petrograd!"
rcw.200.d:0 "After the ROVS seized power, proclaiming Kornilov as interim president, Petrograd workers began to strike against the military, demanding free elections and an increase in their standard of living.\n\nThe first strike began with the Putilov plant, but by noon the strike had engulfed all major industrial enterprises of the capital and gained mass character. The police forces were not enough to suppress the protest, and the next day the strike continued and other citizens who were dissatisfied with the seizure of power by the military joined the protest.\n\nThe situation escalated and became sharply radicalized when a number of generals sympathetic to the proletariat sided with the rebels. While the uprising in Petrograd has not spread to other regions with the effect of falling dominoes, we need to nip it in the bud, either by suppressing the uprising harshly, or make concessions to the working class and, despite the crisis, meet their demands."
rcw.200.a:0 "Power to the Toilers!"
rcw.200.b:0 "We shall deal with the insurgency!"

rcw.201.t:0 "Leaders of the Protest Evolved"
rcw.201.d:0 "The protests of Petrograd workers have been going on for several days, and so far the riot looks disjointed and without clear leaders. Of those who are capable of leading a crowd, so far not a single party has stood up for the workers.\n\nHowever, today the news came that generals who defected to the side of the rebels arrived in Petrograd, and among them, none other than General Yegorov became one of those who spoke at a protest rally of many thousands. The general, quite energetic, announced his intention to create a Petrograd Soviet that would lead the protest uprising. Many, however, took this idea warily, remembering how the last time an institution with the same name failed. Many were afraid of a new civil war, and distrusted the general, who was fought for the Bolsheviks during the Civil War. \n\nOn the other hand, the charismatic leader of the Left SRs, Maria Spiridonova, spoke at the protest rally, who fervently convinced the audience of the need for an immediate revolution, until the reactionaries in the person of the ROVS condemned the workers and peasants to a new slavery. She called for the transfer of all power in the country to trade unions and peasant councils under the auspices of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party and announced that until the bulk of the working people join the uprising, it is doomed to failure.\n\nToday has passed without much upheaval, but in the near future the protesters will need to make a choice that will decide the fate of the whole of Russia in the near future - the collegial power of trade unions and councils of Left SRs or transfer all the power to the Red Generals for effective military action against reactionaries."
rcw.201.a:0 "The Left SRs should lead the protest!"
rcw.201.b:0 "Red Generals should lead the protest!"

rcw.202.t:0 "The Protest Spreads Among Large Cities"
rcw.202.d:0 "The example of the Petrograd uprising was followed by other major cities of Russia, in which thousands of workers also held rallies, and in fact chaos ensued in the cities, since neither the police nor the armed forces could cope with the working class, driven by a single energy and force.\n\nTrade unions, factory committees, cooperatives - all called for an all-Russian strike and the transfer of power to representatives of the working class. According to rumors, the ROVS had to go to the south of Russia and organize an operation center in Volgograd, where their support was still quite strong. The working people have gained a lot of strength and energy under the awareness of the fact that many cities have already risen to the defense of the working class.\n\nHowever, at the same time, newspapers announced that a delegation of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party, headed by Bolshevik Zinoviev, had arrived incognito in Petrograd from abroad. They were seen at one of the rallies in the capital, where they called for an armed struggle and the unification of workers under the rule of the Bolshevik Party. This event caused a resonance among the population, many of whom remembered the failure of the Bolsheviks and the Red Terror, and distrusted them. Others, albeit a minority, picked up the revolutionary slogans of the RKP and called on the rest to listen to the Bolshevik leaders, who suggest support and help for the Russian Revolution from the friendly Third Internationale Countries."
rcw.202.a:0 "Immediately arrest the Bolsheviks!"
rcw.202.b:0 "They will be useful in the upcoming revolution!"

rcw.203.t:0 "Homogeneous Socialist Government"
rcw.203.d:0 "Since the Party of the Left SRs seized the initiative and became the leaders of the protests, they realized the need to convene a homogeneous socialist government with the participation of all the socialist parties in Russia. Already today, this decision has been made and the Extraordinary Supreme Council of Workers and Peasants under the leadership of Maria Spiridonova has become the head of the new revolutionary government, where representatives of the NSP in the person of Bukharin and Tomsky, as well as Mensheviks-Internationalists in the person of the leader of the VTsSPS, Lozovsky, also received ministerial seats. \n\nThe news of the creation of the ChVSRK and a homogeneous socialist government quickly went around the entire European part of Russia, and in many rural regions, peasants and workers announced the creation of local councils and subordination to the central government. Many regions joined the all-Russian uprising, with the exception of those regions where the sentiments of Savinkov's associates were strong, who, despite his pro-peasant views, was ignored by the Supreme Soviet.\n\nNow that power in large cities and rural regions has come under the control of the Soviets of workers and peasants, the ChVSRK hope for the speedy subordination of the rest of Russia to the working people."

rcw.2030.d:0 "Savinkov's People's Republican Party, or NRPR, suggests that they should also join our government, as they represent a great deal of peasants in Russia. However, the ChVSRK in general does not trust Savinkov, despite him being a former SR and his economic programme. They still believe that he is generally anti-socialist and his party should not participate in our new Soviet republic."

rcw.204.t:0 "Pacification of Tambov"
rcw.204.d:0 "The peasants in Tambov and the surrounding regions are the only ones who refused to recognize the power of the Soviets. In this region, the support of the NRPR is very high, as well as the Green Army of Antonov, who, although he himself was a left SR before, joined Savinkov after the civil war. \n\nWe need to seize power in Tambov, where the socialists are not completely deprived of support and convince the population of the reactionary views of the people's Republicans. If we cannot convince them to join the true force representing the working class, that we will have to fight them already by armed means."

rcw.206.d:0 "We have lost Petrograd, the workers' protest in the capital has been going on for several days. However, so far the rebellion looks fragmented and without clear leaders. Of those who are able to lead the crowd, so far not a single party has stood up for the workers. \n\nNevertheless, there are several candidates whom Kornilov suspects of becoming protest leaders.\nFirstly, these are some generals who had ties with the Reds during the Civil War or who sympathize with the workers and peasants. The most notable are Aleksandr Yegorov, Boris Shaposhnikov and some others. We can arrest them immediately to ensure that they don't become leaders, however this may not be enough as there are various socialist parties that would like to lead the protest."

rcw.207.d:0 "Having arrested the Red Generals, we have cut the Petrograd workers off the military support. However, there is still something we should concern.\n\nAmong one of Kornilov's main concerns are left-wing Social revolutionaries who have intercepted the workers' agenda and are looking for opportunities to lead the revolution. In addition, they are one of the few parties that openly called for revolution. We can try to arrest the leaders of the Left SRs before they can lead the protest, but for this we will most likely have to turn to the help of Savinkov's combat detachments."
rcw.207.a:0 "Try to arrest Left SRs."

rcw.208.d:0 "An experienced general, Alexander Yegorov, who served on the side of the Bolsheviks during the Civil War, after its end fell under Kerensky's amnesty, and became one of the successful military leaders in the army of the Republic. However, his socialist views, which always questioned his loyalty, were confirmed.\n\nYegorov arrived in Petrograd, where he led revolutionary soldiers and workers and announced the creation of a socialist republic. He was joined by other generals of our army, with socialist views. Now we have to fight with former colleagues for our homeland."

rcw.209.d:0 "Having revealed the plan of the traitor generals and arrested the leaders of the socialist opposition in time, we were able to stop their attempts to lead the uprisings and actually suppressed the uprising in the bud. Despite thousands of demonstrations, federal troops brought into the city together with the police and the BO-NPR were able to restore order. The workers had to return to the factories, and the general strike failed."
rcw.209.a:0 "Victory of the ROVS!"

rcw.210.t:0 "The Protest Spreads Among Large Cities"
rcw.210.d:0 "The example of the Petrograd uprising was followed by other major cities of Russia, in which thousands of workers also held rallies, and in fact chaos reigned in the cities, since neither the police nor the armed forces could cope with the working class, driven by a single energy and force. Trade unions, factory committees, cooperatives - all called for an all-Russian strike and the transfer of power to representatives of the working class.\n\nUnfortunately, the new Russian government led by Kornilov had to go to the south of Russia and organize an operational center in Volgograd, where their support was still quite strong."
rcw.210.a:0 "We must go south!"

rcw.211.t:0 "The Peasants Join the Revolution"
rcw.211.d:0 "Unfortunately, the example of the cities was followed by the peasants. Many villages and hamlets soon also announced their accession to the new socialist government, and thus, most of European Russia was under the rule of socialists."

rcw.212.t:0 "Siberian Dual Power"
rcw.212.d:0 "With the creation of an independent Siberian state, a group of Eastern Oblastniks headed by Ivan Lavrov seized power. However, now, largely at the instigation of the workers of large industrial Siberian centers, the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of Siberia, or Centrosibir, has been formed.\n\nIn fact, Centrosibir was recreated by analogy with the first Civil War, by a local activist from the NRA, Boris Shumyatsky. In 1918, Centrosibir fell to the White forces, but now a lot can change, because in a vast territory that is not yet controlled by any White general, the chances of a successful uprising are higher."
rcw.212.a:0 "Centrosibir ousts Oblastniks."
rcw.212.b:0 "Workers' revolt failed, Centrosibir is dissolved."

rcw.213.t:0 "Oblastniki Control Siberia"
rcw.213.d:0 "Together with the beginning of the Russian Civil War, Siberia found itself in a state of semi-anarchy, until the power there passed into the hands of the Oblastniki in the person of Ivan Lavrov.

rcw.218.t:0 "Pale Horse"
rcw.218.d:0 "With the revolutionary workers and peasants seizing the towns and villages, the region of Tambov is under the control of the Green Armies, Combat Squads and Savinkov. After our attempt to approach the Vozhd of Peasants and ask him to join our side, he demanded that Kornilov should make him his head of government, thus alienating us from other generals, mainly Drozdovsky and Wrangel, who are staunch monarchists. If we accept his terms, it will be more easy for us to win the war, but we can expect Wrangel's insurgency."

rcw.262.d: "When the Russian Revolutionary Front was first proclaimed in Tambov and other mainly peasant regions, a large proportion of peasants still had great sentiments towards the Petrograd new government. While the Combat Squads and the Green Armies have been efficiently eliminating any peasant unrest since then, the population waited for victories. One of those could have been the capture of Moscow, providing the Revolutionary Front with much needed industry and great propaganda source. However, it never happened...\n\nEach day the popularity of the Vozhd's regime was weakening, and the peasant riots were harder to contain. Finally, the unrest became too large to control. The peasants, have started their provocations en-masse, claiming that Savinkov is only a failure, and true Revolution lies in Petrograd and Moscow. Not only the peasants, but some of the military officers have also felt this, quickly denouncing the Vozhd.\n\nSoon, major cities had been seized by the rioters, including [ROOT.Capital.GetName]. Initially, Savinkov went into hiding, but he was rather soon discovered, arrested and quickly shot by a Revolutionary Tribunal of his own creation. The new leadership has proclaimed People's Victory and has willingly joined the [RUS.GetName], allowing their forces to quickly occupy all of the Revolutionary Front."
rcw.262.a: "Victory of People!"

rcw.263.a: "Strike them!"
rcw.263.b: "No need, we'll deal with them later."


rcw.500.t: "The Loss of [FROM.FROM.GetName]!"
rcw.500.d: "The disturbing news arrived from the frontline, as we receive official confirmaton that the city of [FROM.FROM.GetName] has been lost to our enemies. The harsh urban warfare has not only turned one magnificent city to a pile of ruins, but also the people lose confidence in our government. Using this, the opposition to our regime is gaining strength, and is trying to prove to the people that they will be better than us."
rcw.500.a: "Awful!"

rcw.501.t: "The Bolshevist Coup"
rcw.501.d: "This morning Bolshevik generals entered the government building with a small group of soldiers and arrested all its members, accusing them of \"betraying the revolution\", \"unnecessary decentralization\", and \"indulging the kulaks\". A little later, the military handed over power to the RKP."
rcw.501.a: "Long live Communism!"

rcw.502.t: "Protests Against Bolsheviks"
rcw.502.d: "Recently, the Bolsheviks and sympathetic generals had staged a coup in which the Left SR government was arrested and imprisoned, and the RKP was now at the helm of the revolution. However, not everyone supported this change. Many peasants, remembering the Bolsheviks' treatment of their class, are already rallying in full force, and anarchists are expressing extreme dissatisfaction with the new and, as they say, \"illegitimate\" government. Before the protests become radicalized, we need to calm the population down"

rcw.504.t: "Mutiny of the Sailors"
rcw.504.d: "Attempts to silence the protesters by force were not completely successful. And while in the villages we managed to disperse the rallying crowd, in Petrograd full-fledged armed clashes with anarchist sailors and the Black Guard began."
rcw.504.a: "To arms! To crush the traitors of the revolution!"

rcw.505.t: "Seizure of the Ports of Petrograd"

rcw.505.b: "We will try to storm the ports and bombard the incoming reinforcements from Kronstadt with guns!"

rcw.506.t: "Storming the Winter Palace"
rcw.506.d: "To everyone's surprise, the unorganized anarchists managed to fight back the Red Guard units, keeping them away from the ports. The reinforcements arriving from Kronstadt continued to push our troops towards the Winter Palace, from where the government had already hastily evacuated. Further, the sailors released the arrested Left SRs from the Peter and Paul Fortress and, supported by cruisers, they stormed the Winter Palace. Having knocked our troops out of Petrograd, they took up the defense"
rcw.506.a: "All reserves to Petrograd!"

rcw.507.t: "Failed Offensive"
rcw.507.d: "The reserves that approached Petrograd were never able to break through the defenses, many people voluntarily joined the ranks of the anarchists. With the help of the occupied telegraph, the rebels sent out a declaration of the \"People's Revolution,\" in which they announced the creation of the \"Committee for the Salvation of the Revolution,\" calling on the people to overthrow the Bolsheviks. Many other cities have already joined the uprising; in the villages, backed by Left SR vigilantes, peasants are taking up arms and shooting our commissars. 
rcw.507.a: "This is the end..."

rcw.508.t: "Anarchist Revolution!"
rcw.508.d: "The uprisings that began recently have taken a disastrous turn! Many have risen up against the illegitimate Bolshevik government. The top brass of the RKP, who tried to evacuate, were arrested at the train station by the Black Guard."
rcw.508.a: "Eh, apple..."

rcw.509.t: "Defense of the Peter and Paul Fortress"
rcw.509.d: "Having decided to take up the defense, detachments of the Red Guards settled in the Peter and Paul Fortress, successfully repelling the sailors' attack, disorganizing them. Now we have a choice - to finish off the rebels or not to test our fate and stay in the defense, waiting for reinforcements?"
rcw.509.a: "Attack! Crush them once and for all!"
rcw.509.b: "Wait for reinforcements"

rcw.510.a: "Mutiny Suppressed"
rcw.510.d: "The arriving reinforcements gave us the opportunity to completely dislodge the sailors from Petrograd. The further organized assault on Kronstadt was given to our troops without much difficulty. The mutineers were captured and later shot"
