### Opinion Modifiers ###

NFL_canadian_suspicion:0 "Distrust of Canada"
NFL_canadian_conspiracy:0 "Accusations of Canadian Meddling"

### Ideas ###

NFL_debt:0 "Crippling Debt"
NFL_debt_desc:0 "Our decisions to build a railway from St. John’s to Port aux Basques and massive military spending during the Great War has incurred surprising amounts of debt for us with dismal interest rates. Our main Creditors are Canada and National France, with another other minor creditor being Australia. Paying back our debts will require a massive amount of time for a nation of our size."

NFL_legacy_of_1932:0 "Memories of 1932"
NFL_legacy_of_1932_desc:0 "The Riot which came about as a result of the Squires’ Government’s corruption almost ended Newfoundlander Democracy as we know it. The ensuing political crisis led to the decimation of the Liberals and Fredrick Alderice’s United Newfoundland Party gaining power. While Responsible Government has thus far held on by a thread, it is clear that most Newfoundlanders, including those Governing the Dominion, have grown disillusioned with Democracy. Frustration with Democracy in the wake of the Great Depression has reached a high, and some wonder that another crisis may just push our nation over the edge."

NFL_corruption:0 "All-Encompassing Corruption"
NFL_corruption_desc:0 ""

NFL_bad_economy:0 "Terrible Economy"
NFL_bad_economy_desc:0 "Attributed to our unfortunate economic reliance on the fish, paper, and mineral exports, and our lack of any industrial or population centers, Newfoundland has been forced into extreme economic hardship. Our economic situation was only worsened by the American Great Depression, and while while the Depression wreaked havoc on our and Canada's economy, it did not fully cripple our nation's economy. With any hope our nation will recover, slowly."

NFL_great_depression:0 "Obliterated Economy"
NFL_great_depression_desc:0 "The Great Depression was a hurdle we could have overcome, however just when we seemed to be on the path to recovery,  the crippling Black Monday depression has completely eviscerated what remains of our fragile economy. The few markets we have access to no longer want to purchase our products, and our creditors don't have enough funds to sustain our economy. We have few assets at our disposal, and if we wish to dig ourselves out of this hole we must work hard. "

NFL_recovering_economy:0 "Recovering Economy"
NFL_recovering_economy_desc:0 "Through hard work we have managed to crawl out our economic hole. Although most of our nation is still a backwater, the extensive investments we have made in our industries have greatly assisted in our nation’s economic progress. While the prospects of full recovery seem grim, significant leeway has been made in our recovery efforts."

NFL_reliance_on_canada:0 "Reliance on Canada"
NFL_reliance_on_canada_desc:0 "Newfoundland has little in terms of domestic resources, leaving us completely reliant on our larger neighbor, the Dominion/Kingdom of Canada. Newfoundland for better or for worse is unbreakably bonded to our elder sibling within the Empire."

NFL_memories_of_the_regiment:0 "Legacy of the Newfoundland Regiment"
NFL_memories_of_the_regiment_desc:0 "Our own Royal Newfoundland Regiment has a storied tradition of bad luck. First suffering cataclysmic losses at Gallipoli, and then losing 90 percent of the regiment during the first Battle of the Somme. Our poor performance in the Weltkreig has been a source of shame for our army, who sees the need to prepare properly for a conflict as paramount. "

### Focuses ###

NFL_commission_of_govt:0 "The Commission of Government"
NFL_commission_of_govt_desc:0 "Following the increasing failure of our native parties and representatives to get us out of the economic rut we’ve been wallowing in for years now, the Canadians have been granted direct Commission of our government. While not too dissimilar to the direct colonial rule we had before being granted dominionship, Our citizenry are very enthusiastic about having a government in charge whose sole task is to alleviate our commonly felt ailing."
NFL_defanged_labour_movement:0 "Defanged Labour Movement"
NFL_defanged_labour_movement_desc:0 "It is typically thought that the fairly conservative population of Newfoundland would never grant syndicalism a breeding place within our unions, yet complacency can kill. So while we will not take direct action against our unionized communities, we will take the precaution of removing their ability to organize leadership and strikes, to prevent the red’s opportunity."
NFL_cooperate_with_coaker:0 "Cooperate with Coaker"
NFL_cooperate_with_coaker_desc:0 "The Commission’s mission is revolving around the key idea of giving faith back into the Newfoundland people, faith in their government to keep their jobs and trade secure. So we should approach the Fishermen’s Protective Union of Coaker and other Labour oriented groups with a velvet glove to give them faith in the Commission’s intentions."
NFL_crush_the_unions:0 "Supress the Unions"
NFL_crush_the_unions_desc:0 "Having a highly unionized population, especially in the fishing trades, Newfoundland’s working population is highly organized. And The Commission, remembering what happened in Britain when a pessimistic union population rallied and brought about the dreadful syndicalist revolution, shall never allow that to happen on this Domain’s shores. numquam dimitte numquam obliviscar!"
NFL_work_with_civilian_govt:0 "Work with the Civilian Government"
NFL_work_with_civilian_govt_desc:0 "While nominally we have total control over the affairs of Newfoundland, we have allowed those already elected to legislature to retain those seats, so long as they were not those convicted of corruption charges. There remains no reason to tread over the Newfoundlanders' self representation, especially when it could further push resistant elements against us."
NFL_crush_cashin:0 "Clear out Cashin's Rabble"
NFL_crush_cashin_desc:0 "A more progressive oriented member of the Liberals, Peter John Cashin had been fine living outside of politics after the loss of his seat. Yet it appears that the appointment of our Commission had just rubbed him wrong, citing our efforts as a Canadian conspiracy against Newfoundland and removal of self-representation. His back-bench revolt against our commission is proving quite the headache, so let us remove more power from his opposition."
NFL_ode_to_newfoundland:0 "Ode to Newfoundland"
NFL_ode_to_newfoundland_desc:0 "With the efforts of the Commission being felt as economic woes begin to glacially drift away from the sheer disaster it was before, and with the Newfoundland people being able to say they joined in the efforts to alleviate themselves out of the depression, it has come with a surge of national pride. Already folk songs are being written, and people see the influence the Commission has made on our isle."
NFL_advisory_committee:0 "Create the Advisory Committee"
NFL_advisory_committee_desc:0 "Although we have taken control over Newfoundland from the natives, we must not totally throw them to the wind as after all, it was Alderdice’s government who invited us here to resolve the economic and corruptive woes of the nation. So we will set up a committee of Native Newfoundlanders of varying ideologies to give advice on how to resolve the state of affairs we see ourselves in."
NFL_rest_from_politics:0 "A Rest from Politics"
NFL_rest_from_politics_desc:0 "It’s apparent that besides the inability of Newfoundland to manage itself, it also has the issue of the two partisan parties of Liberals and United Newfoundland Party to point fingers at each other in a manner which only further divides the tired nation. We will put a hold on this divisive politicking by freezing elections, with the Newfoundland legislature being resigned to the members currently in office remaining there."
NFL_benevolent_dictatorship:0 "A Benevolent Dictatorship"
NFL_benevolent_dictatorship_desc:0 "It was never the intention of the colonial office’s assigned governor to trample over Newfoundlander life and liberty, and so the wider Commission will ensure that it is not viewed as a seizure of democratic ideals, but of a body of temporary caretakers, a government of nannies to bandage the gash that the great depression put into Newfoundland."
NFL_continue_commission_activies:0 "Continue Commission Activities"
NFL_continue_commission_activies_desc:0 "With the startling finds in the Amulree report showing a complete inability of Newfoundlanders to maintain their coffers, their education system and keep corruption to a minimum, the Commission has shown a lack of faith in returning leadership back over just yet. And so while there remains this large of an issue in Newfoundland’s very core, Ottawa’s influence is here to stay."
NFL_early_restoration_of_democracy:0 "Preemptive Democratic Restoration"
NFL_early_restoration_of_democracy_desc:0 "With the wishes of the Canadian foreign office to put all effort into future liberation of the Home Isles, we must make the call to end the Commission whenever best available, and with the economic woes of Newfoundland receding quicker than expected, we can restore democracy back to the natives before any anxiety over autonomy needlessly grows."
NFL_amulree_report:0 "The Amulree Report"
NFL_amulree_report_desc:0 "First Baron Amulree, William Mackenzie is finally ready to report his discoverings about Newfoundland’s economy, its state of affairs in education, resource extraction and further look into the effects of the depression (and now black monday) upon the dominion. Its expected the report will be bleak, but once the Commission is granted clarity over our hardships, they can immediately set to work upon fixing our woes."
NFL_direct_releif_efforts:0 "Direct Relief Efforts"
NFL_direct_releif_efforts_desc:0 "What should have been considered extinct in the dominions of the Entente, malnutrition and famine is beginning to peek it’s unwelcome head into our beloved Newfoundland, as the economic state has meant that the ability to purchase food is increasingly in danger as time has not proven kindly to our fishers and communities. The commission will not allow people to drop dead from hunger under their watch, so let the soup kitchens open!"
NFL_pay_down_our_debt:0 "Pay Down our Debts"
NFL_pay_down_our_debt_desc:0 "One further burden upon the Dominion’s back was the pressured need to pay back Canada, the Algiers regime and Australasia for the loans we had taken out back during the Weltkrieg and irresponsible construction projects. The Commission if anything is further harried by this pressure, as they answer directly back to Ottawa and so must set about actually completing the task of alleviating our debts."
NFL_crown_corporations:0 "Assistance from Crown Corporations"
NFL_crown_corporations_desc:0 "Utilized by Ottawa to great extent to both drag themselves out of the Depression, but also to maintain employment and military prowess, Crown Corporations can be a very welcome addition to the Newfoundland regiment and its industry."
NFL_canadian_aid:0 "Aid from Canada"
NFL_canadian_aid_desc:0 "Utilizing Canada’s willingness to actually give material support to the Commission over a potentially irresponsible Newfoundlander government, we shall request the machinery and material aid to begin building more of an industry to employ the populace in. We proved to be loyal to the cause in the first Weltkrieg, let us again prove our worth in a potential second Weltkrieg with the smokestacks of industry."
NFL_deal_with_corruption:0 "Dealing with Corruption"
NFL_deal_with_corruption_desc:0 "Unfortunately one of the most damning discoveries by the Amulree Report was that the corruption that had been known during the Squires premiership was not final, and that even the UNP that succeeded the liberals had many shady dealings of public funds. If we are to return control back over to elected parties, then we must purge the seemingly entrenched spoils system of Newfoundlander governance."
NFL_balance_the_books:0 "Balance the Books"
NFL_balance_the_books_desc:0 "It is commonly known by both Newfoundlanders and by our creditors back in Canada, that one of the biggest factors for Newfoundland’s debt and near bankruptcy is because of the expenses of the Newfoundland Railway. Yet surprisingly even after the sheer losses incurred by it, the Commission has found that the prior governments of Liberals and United both kept putting money towards it. It’s time the Commission made this revelation public and finally cut the costs of these continued expenditures."
NFL_sale_of_labrador:0 "The Sale of Labrador"
NFL_sale_of_labrador_desc:0 "These are dire times for the Dominion, and if the Commission is to sustain any credibility about their genuine effort to restore the economy back to its prior state, then we might have to consider more drastic options. The larger landmass of Labrador in the dominion has not had many returns to efforts to profit off it, and so in order to procure funds of our own, we may have to auction it off to Canada."
NFL_further_borrowing:0 "Further Borrowing"
NFL_further_borrowing_desc:0 "Whilst Newfoundland debt is already a known issue, it has become apparent to the Commission of Government that if we are to begin the public work and employment efforts to get the Dominion’s economy kickstarted, we will have to consider requesting more grants from Ottawa to even fund these projects, though that means the foreseen problem of just rising our loan interest higher."
NFL_civil_service_cuts:0 "Civil Service Cuts"
NFL_civil_service_cuts_desc:0 "An unwelcome measure, but in order to further unburden our financial state, we will have to begin laying off the public servants of the prior dominion administrations, ones that are no longer essential to the operation of the government with the introduction of the Commission. We will have to contemplate what sectors to lay off, but it’s estimated at least 1/3rd must go."
NFL_towards_corpratism:0 "Towards Corporatism"
NFL_towards_corpratism_desc:0 "The Commission has outlined, much to the chagrin of some elements within Newfoundland, an ambitious plan to heal our ailing economy. Our storm-bound lands shall be barren no longer, as the Commission works to build a true class-collaborative wonderland, lush with jobs and economic opportunities for our citizens. While the state-funding and nationalization of key industries is derided as Syndicalism by our traditional Merchant base, we trust that a non-Syndicalist collectivist system is our best way to reach a prosperous future. "

NFL_second_commission:0 "The Second Commission"
NFL_second_commission_desc:0 "With the attempt to restore autonomy to the Newfoundland people and give faith back into their representative parties ending up in failure, a second Royal Commission of Governance has been issued from Ottawa, and this one is much more open to Canadian influence as the assigned Commission’s patience has thinned."
NFL_state_capitalism:0 "Institute State Capitalism"
NFL_state_capitalism_desc:0 "Both to keep Newfoundland’s economy afloat in dire times, but also to ensure it is fully attuned to wartime readiness much like Newfoundland was during the First Weltkrieg, we shall have the Commission have a active hand in the management of Mercantile business and trade here on this isle."
NFL_clean_up_govt:0 "Cleaning up the Government"
NFL_clean_up_govt_desc:0 "In order to keep the Commissions grasp over Newfoundland steady, while also ensuring punishment of those who had kept knocking the dominion into the dirt due to their corrupt practices, we will use the Commission assigned Attorney General to try and prosecute those ministers of all previous government’s who had a hand in the dealings."
NFL_imperial_industry:0 "Imperial Industry"
NFL_imperial_industry_desc:0 "Whereas before, the Commission had welcomed yet paced the Crown Corporations and Industries entering Newfoundland to ensure they were just additions rather than a takeover of native markets, this concern is not to be contemplated with this second rite of government. Much needed manufactories will be opened directly upon the isle to industrialize."
NFL_formal_mercantalism:0 "Formalize the Mercantilist System"
NFL_formal_mercantalism_desc:0 "While Newfoundland fishermen had always been very keen on exporting their labour and business abroad to any who would give them coin, this prior practice had been very self-centered and even harmful to the bay communities at home. Thus the Commission will embrace the export of Newfoundland goods, but with the goal of enriching the dominion."
NFL_quaerite_prime_regnum_dei:0 "Quaerite Prime Regnum Dei"
NFL_quaerite_prime_regnum_dei_desc:0 "Love thy neighbor as one loves thyself. And now with the Commission having to ask itself if the effort to put faith and power back into Newfoundlander hands will end up in disappointment once more, if rather the solution to be found is bringing the loyal dominion into the Canadian fold, where they will surely find better funding and governance than from the repeated failures of the self."
NFL_further_suspension_of_civil_liberties:0 "Further Suspension of Civil Liberties"
NFL_further_suspension_of_civil_liberties_desc:0 "With the citizenry having come into disrest once more with the failings of the previous elected government to handle the finances, a disgusting mirror of the riot of ‘32 happened. Now with it being apparent that the Newfoundland people are willing to surge into the streets against the government if they feel unsatisfied, we need to be more strict in our law enforcement."
NFL_danger_of_democracy:0 "The Dangers of Democracy"
NFL_danger_of_democracy_desc:0 "Going off the first commission’s very warm welcome into Newfoundland due to the citizenry’s own lack of faith in their elected representatives, we will piggyback off rousing this belief into a flame against any further elections and organization of executive or legislative leadership by the people, for what good has ever come to this island from those efforts?"
NFL_emphasise_temporary_nature:0 "Refuse to Abandon Democracy"
NFL_emphasise_temporary_nature_desc:0 "Despite the continued follies of mismanaged finances here in Newfoundland, the Commission will do no favors to the people it is trying to assist by setting up a permanent station here, completely stripping Newfoundlanders of their autonomy. Thus we shall once more go hand in hand with the advisory committee and strive to make elections possible once more."
NFL_wartime_emergency_powers:0 "Temporary Emergency Powers"
NFL_wartime_emergency_powers_desc:0 "With Newfoundland and the wider Entente going into a wartime state as the march towards liberation begins, The Commission will have to secure and mobilize the isle to ensure our readiness for war with the syndicalist menace. But we shall legislate our wartime laws so that they are just temporary, much like the commission's authority."

NFL_plot_begins:0 "The Plot Against Canada"
NFL_plot_begins_desc:0 "While many have graciously allowed the Canadians to trample on our sovereignty without fuss, a certain number of workers, ever tired of the tyranny of the bosses, have reached their breaking point. The workers of Newfoundland have had enough of Newfoundland’s Merchant Master Class and their Canadian enablers; and while dislodging them may take a constrained effort, we are ready for whatever tribulations breaking our chains may entail."
NFL_mobilize_opposition_against_the_commission:0 "Mobilize Opposition Against the Commission"
NFL_mobilize_opposition_against_the_commission_desc:0 "Before the tyranny of the Commission put an end to any such faint dreams of Democracy, a great man by the name of Richard Squires fought tooth and nail along with Coaker to ensure that our workers would breathe free. Derided by the Merchants and the Newspapers under their sway, Squires’ tenure would not last, uprooted tragically by the great Riot of ‘32. Ever a champion of returning to our democracy lost, Squires has been left with no other options; the Commission is here to stay, and the best chance to return the power of Newfoundland’s fate to its people resides with the Union of Britain. A great irony, considering how much Squires fought against associations with Syndicalists during his time in power.. . "
NFL_recruit_unemployed:0 "Recruit the Unemployed"
NFL_recruit_unemployed_desc:0 "A great many men in St. Johns lie destitute and desperate for any means of income. Seeing this as an opportunity, the Syndicalists have recruited these men as agitators, ever eager to tear down the systems of Oppression the moment the right moment strikes. The decline of the FPU shall be reversed, as we spread our brand of Unionism from the traditional stronghold of the fisheries, into the mines and forests, where loggers and miners toil in unfair conditions ."
NFL_organize_the_unions:0 "Organize the Unions"
NFL_organize_the_unions_desc:0 "The Fishermen's Protective Union has long battled for the inherent rights of every worker. In the process, the FPU has amassed a large amount of sway within the Newfie political scene. While the Commission has cracked down on such ‘Syndicalist’ organizations, the workers of Newfoundland continue to commiserate and meet under the banner of the FPU despite it being officially outlawed. Just like in Britain, a revolution is brewing; and the Unions are set to be first to answer the Clarion Call once the Revolution arrives."
NFL_abandon_nonradicalism:0 "Abandon Non-Radicalism"
NFL_abandon_nonradicalism_desc:0 "So long has the Fishermen's Protective Union been derided as a Syndicalist organization, despite every assurance otherwise. At a certain point fighting accusations of Syndicalism has become fighting against our own interests; now, Syndicalism stands as our only hope to free the working men of Newfoundland from the bosses’ oppression. If the Merchants want to see what a truly Syndicalist workingman's organization looks like, they are about to bear witness to the dawn of true Unionism. "
NFL_sabatoge_recovery_efforts:0 "Sabotage Recovery Efforts"
NFL_sabatoge_recovery_efforts_desc:0 "While most workers see through the veneer for what the Commission truly is, some have been fooled by their lukewarm promises of economic recovery. To prevent our more gullible citizenry from being swayed by the Commission’s Siren Song, we must sabotage the Commission’s efforts to help the economy recover. The workers of Newfoundland shall be made to see that the only solution to their woes is the guiding hand of Syndicalism."
NFL_cooperate_with_cashin:0 "The Cashin-Coaker Alliance"
NFL_cooperate_with_cashin_desc:0 "Peter John Cashin and William Coaker have forged a strange partnership. While typically Coaker would want nothing to do with such a brazen plot against the Empire, the wanton persecution of the FPU by the Commission has driven Coaker to desperate means. Through violent or nonviolent means, Coaker and Cashin are determined to dismantle the Commission and Imperial influence in Newfoundland once and for all."
NFL_anti_canadian_fearmongering:0 "Fearmonger Against the Canadians"
NFL_anti_canadian_fearmongering_desc:0 "The Canadians have never stopped attempting to control Newfoundland, from the Labrador Boundary Disputes of the past, to their unjust usurpation of British Duties.

NFL_mobilize_veterans:0 "Never Another Somme, Never Another Hamel, Never Another Gallipoli"
NFL_mobilize_veterans_desc:0 "Hamel, the Somme, Gallipoli. All battles fought in wars on foreign shores where brave sons of Newfoundland laid down their lives for London's bitter lies of 'Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori'. Years after the slaughter 'King and Country' once more calls to use our people as mere fodder in their madman's dream of reclaiming a lost Empire. The veterans of foreign wars fought under the Union Jack have now come to realize that they have been forsaken by the very Empire they once fought to protect. As the Canadians ready themselves for a surely suicidal advance against the London Government, the people of Newfoundland are united under this chant: 'Never Another Somme, Never Another Hamel, Never Another Gallipoli'."
NFL_appeal_to_smalwood:0 "Get Smallwood on Our Side"
NFL_appeal_to_smalwood_desc:0 "It has come as a surprise to many that Joey Smallwood, the darling of the Confederationist Movement and one of the strongest supporters of Squires’ Government, was once of Newfoundland’s most fervent red-blooded Socialists. Despite abandoning his Socialist ideals to be more palatable to our nonradical political scene, Smallwood, along with his Newfoundland Federation of Labour, have been driven firmly to the side of Coaker’s plot. It has unfortunately become clear that the Unions of Newfoundland can no longer coexist with the Commission, and for our fair Terra Nova to be free from the bosses, we must turn to radical; even Syndicalist means. "

Alone and far-removed from Europe’s epicenters of Socialism, our hopes for survival against a superior Canadian foe are slim; to even have a fighting chance, we must turn to London for any support that could possibly be given. The Union of Britain will begin supplying our revolution-to-be, allowing us to covertly prepare for our uprising, hopefully without drawing too much suspicion from the Canadians."

newfoundland.1.t:0 "The First Dominion"
newfoundland.1.d:0 "During their social gatherings in Ottawa, the Exiles fondly reminisce about the complex history of the Anglo presence in Canada, particularly in Newfoundland. Their nostalgia for the empire that slipped from their grasp a decade earlier is evident as they reflect on how the foundation of that empire was laid with the acquisition of Newfoundland. Although Jamestown's settlement in Virginia predates Newfoundland's significance, England's earliest settlements in the New World were indeed established within Newfoundland, notably Cuper's Cove. Over the following centuries, the region witnessed a tumultuous history marked by colonial conflicts between native tribes and the French, leading to attempts to eradicate the entire colony. However, in 1825, Newfoundland became a Crown colony under British control, initiating the next chapter in its development. Subsequently, the colony drafted a constitution, appointed its first governor, and achieved self-governing status in 1854, with Philip Francis Little as its inaugural premier. A significant milestone occurred in 1907 when Newfoundland attained Dominion status within the empire, coinciding conveniently with the outbreak of the First Weltkrieg. This change marked an increase in level of autonomy for the island, further shaping its small role in the larger British Empire. The bitter failures of the Great War were felt strongly in Newfoundland, who's own intense contributions were ultimately in vain. The British Revolution further shook Newfoundland, as the Liberal/FUP Government of Richard Squires and William Coaker was smeared by opponents accusing them of following the same thread of Syndicalism present in the Union of Britain. While the Union Presence was strong in Newfoundland, ideas such as Syndicalism failed to spread into the isolated and socially conservative fishing communities that comprised a majority of their base.\n Formally the last part of the British Empire, jurisdiction of Newfoundland was formally transferred to Canada in 1926, an act which infuriated those who were less than trusting to their Canadian neighbors. The 'usurpation' of duties by Canada has been often a point of contention, with many such as Peter John Cashin desiring 'radical' solutions to free Newfoundland from Canadian influence.\n While we have adjusted to Canadian rule in many ways, Newfoundland's fragile economy and political scene have often put our democratic institutions to the test, with the smouldering anti-democratic sentiment bursting into flame after the unsavoury and corrupt practices of the Squires government were revealed to the general public. This incident would almost mean the death of Responsible Government in Newfound; fortunately due to Canadian mediation and a snap election being held, Newfoundlander Democracy was salvaged. For now at least, it appears that the status quo is safe, however any radical change in our already uneasy situation may prove disastrous, and could very well spell the end of the Dominion as we know it...

The king had been suffering from ill health for some time and his death was not unexpected, having shirked away from the public some time ago. His death marked the end of an era and the beginning of another one, with his son, Edward VIII, who stands ready to ascend to the throne. The nation was struck by a profound sense of loss as they realized there was no longer a King to lead them. In contrast to the Ottawa government, which is heavily influenced by the Exiles, Newfoundland possesses an intimate connection with the Exiles and London that dates back to before the revolution. Having achieved dominion status in 1907, Newfoundlanders felt a deep bond with the monarchy and the United Kingdom. Even during the tumultuous Weltkrieg, the nation proudly raised its own infantry regiment to fight for the King and defend shared values. As Prince Edward prepares to take the throne, Newfoundlanders reflect on their history, proud of their dominion status. While the Exiles might not have been as strong here, Newfoundlanders cherish their enduring connection to the King in Ottawa, and mourn his passing. With Prince Edward's succession, there is hope that this bond will continue to foster a sense of unity and loyalty to the Crown."

newfoundland.3.d:0 "The Berlin Stock Exchange failure has triggered a catastrophic chain of events on unprecedented scale, leading to what is now known as Black Monday. Panic has swept across the globe, prompting investors to withdraw savings from banks and funds from the stock market. While we initially thought we might be shielded from the immediate impact due to our distance from the German sphere, the repercussions of the crash soon reached our shores as the global economy crumbled. Black Monday has dealt a devastating blow to the already struggling economies of Canada and the United States, both still reeling from the effects of their Great Depressions. Newfoundland, already facing financial challenges from the completion of a railroad across the dominion in the 1890s and the costs incurred during the raising of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment in the Weltkrieg, has been hit particularly hard. Several of our banks have collapsed, leaving people in financial disarray, unable to access their savings and struggling to afford the necessities of life. Newfoundland's situation is dire, and immediate action must be taken to prevent complete chaos. The impact of the economic downturn is felt throughout our nation, and our citizens face significant hardship. Only through decisive and effective action can we hope to navigate these turbulent times and pave the way towards a brighter future for Newfoundland."

newfoundland.4.d:0 "The situation in Newfoundland has reached a critical point, with our coffers depleted, leaving us on the brink of bankruptcy. The state of the economy is dire, and it has become painfully evident that the current government is no longer capable of functioning effectively. In light of these circumstances, there are two potential courses of action to consider: the establishment of a Canadian Commission or seeking annexation by Canada. The pressing financial crisis has rendered our government virtually powerless to address mounting challenges. Implementing a Commission of Government could provide a temporary solution by appointing a group of experts to take control and manage the affairs of the dominion. This is until our financial stability is restored and our economic woes are no more. This option, though it may help us navigate through the immediate crisis, raises concerns about our autonomy and decision-making. On the other hand, seeking annexation from Canada is another option that has been considered. Joining Canada could offer us access to abundant resources, stability, and a stronger economic framework to aid us in our recovery. However, this path also raises questions about our identity as a distinct entity and the potential loss of our own autonomy."

The Ottawa government is currently preoccupied with addressing its own financial woes, and integrating Newfoundland would strain its resources and hinder its recovery efforts.

As the successor to the now-defunct United Newfoundland Party, Monroe has come out of retirement to lead the remains of Newfoundland's fractured Conservative movement when and if Newfoundland returns to Democracy.\n\n Newfoundlanders remember his tireless efforts to keep the democratic system intact while grappling with severe economic challenges.

However as the election campaign kicks off, the question of the Liberal Party's stances have once more come up. Squires, ever the champion of the 'Old Order' has stated his willingness to continue the 'Old Alliance' between the Liberals and the FPU, which has been in decline in recent years. To the FPU, cooperation with the Liberals seems to be the best way to score some much-needed influence in the House of Assembly, as they currently hold next to no influence after nearly a decade of collapsing poll numbers. However this focus on cooperation has worked to alienate many pro-Confederation members of the party, mainly one Joey Smallwood. Smallwood, while a supporter and ally to William Coaker and the Newfoundland Union scene, has also chastised Squires for his noncommittal stance towards Confederation. Additionally, Smallwood's 'Confederates' have also used popular discontent with the Liberal Party's corruption as a leverage to further advance their agenda within Newfoundland's Liberal Political Scene.\n\n The only question that remains for Squires is if he will seek to pander to Smallwood's Confederates, or keep up the 'Old Alliance' with the FPU.

Despite detractors labeling Smallwood's movement as a 'Single-Issue Party', Smallwood himself has many of his own policies to bring to the table. As the founder of the Newfoundland Federation of Labour, Smallwood's left-leaning agenda has appealed to Newfoundland's lower-class voters; a demographic which the Liberal Party will have to fiercely compete for.

newfoundland.15.d:0 "The Newfoundland Royal Commission has released its own findings, drawing parallels with the efforts of the West Indian Royal Commission, headed by Sir Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne. The comprehensive report, known as the Amulree Report, delves into intricate details, explaining how Newfoundland's political culture exacerbated its economic instability. The findings shed light on crucial aspects of Newfoundland's governance and economy. Newfoundland's mercantile elite never fully embraced the democratic government's potential, the report reveals. They regarded the system as expensive, cumbersome, and inefficient, leading them to grant power carelessly to individuals lacking education and experience. This fostered a culture of corruption and patronage, as mercenary politicians vied to secure votes. The political system, unfortunately, is built on widespread corruption, undermining responsible government. Moreover, the Amulree Report exposes deep sectarian rivalries within the country's government, which adds to the government's challenges. As the financial crises deepened in the 1930s, certain merchants and their allies grew increasingly anxious about their own finances. Fearing bankruptcy and debt defaults, they entertained the idea of suspending the constitution and entrusting the country's affairs to a "commission" to safeguard their wealth. For them, sacrificing a responsible government seemed like a small price to pay for financial stability. Regrettably, many Newfoundlanders sympathized with this sentiment, due to government and corruption scandals in the 1920s. Administrations were short-lived, plagued by defections and shifting alliances. The nation found itself in political turmoil, hindering progress and development. In addition to political issues, the Amulree Report also highlights the economy's complexity and its susceptibility to external factors. Global events, such as the Weltkrieg, affected Newfoundland's financial stability. While the construction of the Newfoundland Railway was initially seen as a step towards progress, it eventually became a heavy financial burden that the nation struggled to bear. The Amulree Report's revelations serve as a sobering reminder of Newfoundland's challenges.

newfoundland.16.d:0 "It appears that due to severe financial issues and near bankruptcy, Newfoundland has put Labrador up for sale. Geographically, it is one of the easternmost provinces on continental Canada and is roughly triangular in shape. Labrador borders Quebec and hosts abundant mineral resources, although it primarily consists of thin soil. Labrador's sale is expected to bring in much needed funds to pay off Newfoundland's debt. It has a population of just a couple of thousand people and is home to a handful of small, rural towns. In the recent past, the provincial government has looked to develop Labrador's natural resources, including petroleum and rare earth minerals. However, the sale of this territory has been met with much opposition from indigenous tribes who claim that the land is their ancestral home and should not be sold off to be exploited."

We cannot be certain if we will ever return to the days of yore. For now, Newfoundland is still under Canadian authority. This interim phase is crucial for establishing stability and rebuilding Britain to its former glory.

This referendum will include our right to responsible government and self-determination, which are crucial for shaping our destiny. During these discussions, some delegates expressed their sympathies with the Ottawa government and proposed integrating into Canada as one of its provinces. Although these individuals represent a minority, their ideas have reached the public through various media channels. They have elaborated on the potential economic and political benefits of such a union. Amidst these varying perspectives, the delegates have largely agreed upon three options: a return to dominion status, maintaining the current Commission of Government arrangement (status quo), or pursuing Confederation with Canada. These choices will be presented to the people in a national referendum, Newfoundland's fate determined by the people's will. In the event that no definite winner is determined in the first referendum, the two options with the highest percentage of votes will proceed to a second referendum, giving the people another opportunity to make their voices heard and shape Newfoundland's future."

The Union of Britain, always looking for ways to undermine their sworn enemies in Ottawa, has taken notice of the discontent brewing in the Dominion of Newfoundland. To help stoke these flames, the UoB has sent [ADVISOR NAME] to St. Johns, with the intent of whipping up a frenzy within the remains of the FPU. Additionally, [ADVISOR NAME] has met privately with William Coaker and Peter John Cashin, two of the most influential figures in the movement against the Commission. Throughout the meeting, Cashin appeared open to working with the Union of Britain if it means casting out the Canadians; even if his views on Syndicalism were far more tepid. Coaker himself is much less open towards Syndicalism, and has on numerous occasions denied that the Fishermen's Protective Union holds any alignment with radical Left-wing movements. Cashin however feels that the brazen crackdown on Organized Labour authorized by the Commission may just get Coaker to change his tune towards the possibility of revolution."

Coaker, while undeniably a dangerous figure in charge of a Union and Political Organization with accused Syndicalist loyalties, is also a Patriot and Subject of the King whose ultimate loyalties lie with the Monarchy. Despite this, Coaker has still been interned along with Cashin for their Anti-Monarchy and Pro-Syndicalist stances. Along with the internment of the would-be Rebellion's leader, the Fishermen's Protective Union and Responsible Government League have been dissolved and declared illegal by the authority of the Commission of Government.

The Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire who once enthusiastically supported the Commission's creation has now come to realize that the only way to truly secure the future of Organized Labour is to do away with Capitalism entirely. The Canadian Government and the Exiles have both proven themselves to be enemies of the working man, and the only way for the brave Labourers of Newfoundland to be truly free is to cast off the chains imposed on us by Canada and the Exiles. The Canadians themselves are very unlikely to accept any such discussion within Newfoundland, and would be sure to snuff out any hint of Revolution the moment they sense it. With that in mind, planning for the Revolution has moved underground, with both Coaker and Cashin attempting to throw the Newfoundland Rangers off of the scent of Revolution. The Union of Britain has quietly begun funding, organizing and preparing for the right moment.

In their own words, we can not possibly support a costly and far-off war declared by out of touch aristocrats when Newfoundland and its citizenry have been left severely hurting for funds and employment. The rangers sent to pad down this crowd of unruly workers expected to simply disperse the gathered crowd; and at worst they would be faced with a repeat of 1932’s harrowing events. Instead, to the horror of the police, the crowd of angry fishermen was heavily armed with British-supplied Submachine Guns. The shots that rang through St. Johns only ended after the mob of Fishermen broke through the hastily set-up ramparts, and stormed the Colonial Building; beating Governor Walwyn to within an inch of his life with the stocks of their British-provided weaponry as he tried to escape. The few members of the Commission who managed to survive quickly boarded a plane to Canada in an attempt to report the news and call in help.\n While they had assumed that this was just a mere riot which had grown out of control, the FPU’s seizure of the Colonial Building, and Coaker’s declaration of a Newfoundlander Revolution has proven that the seeds of Syndicalist discontent has run far deeper than the Commission has ever predicted..."

While the source of these arms could easily be written off as old hunting rifles, some eyewitnesses recall that the weapons used were military-grade and resembled those used by our arch-enemy: the Union of Britain.

nfl_uprising.19.d:0 "The Commission of Government, originally tasked to manage Newfoundland's economy, has been undermined by a crippling inability to respond to an increasingly militant labour movement. Public approval of the Commission in recent months has bottomed out in the single digits, as the vast majority of Newfoundland condemn the Commission as a failed project. The Canadian Government has responded to this by sacking the current leadership of the Commission, reshuffling the Cabinet and instituting a greater focus on padding down tensions within the Dominion. This Cabinet Shuffle has replaced many of the Commission's Exile Ministers with Canadian ones, signaling a shift in Commission policy towards Canada, possibly in an attempt to curry favour with those in Newfoundland who favour Confederation with Canada.\n\n Despite the Commission fearing that an armed uprising is imminent, Ottawa has refused to take these concerns seriously, stating that the Newfoundland Rangers and Royal Newfoundland Constabulary were more than enough to deal with any potential Labour Conflicts."

nfl_flavour.1.t:0 "New England Occupied"
nfl_flavour.1.d:0 "As the Second American Civil War rages, the Canadian Government, ever careful of affairs regarding their neighbors to the south, have finally decided to take drastic action. At 18:00 [GetDateText], Canadian Soldiers Garrisoned at Fredericton and Sherbrooke crossed the border with the United States, and took control of the States of Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, as well as areas of the State of New York outside of NYC and Long Island. This 'occupation' was brought on by a formal request by the governors of these States, who have instructed their National Guard Units to assist the Canadian Authorities.\n\n This incident, while greatly inflaming tensions between Ottawa and Washington, has also had its effect here in Newfoundland. With our proximity to New England, many soldiers from the Royal Newfoundland Regiment and Royal Newfoundland Constabulary aided in Canadian operations in the area. Additionally, plans for a 'New England Provisional Government' have reportedly been modeled on those used by our own Government in St. Johns. Whether or not they will, the fact remains that Canada now has two semi-independent entities to manage on the Eastern Atlantic Seabord."

nfl_flavour.2.t:0 "Refugees Arrive in St. Johns"
nfl_flavour.2.d:0 "Years of tensions South of the Border have finally erupted in a massive Civil Conflict in the now-Former United States. The outbreak of war in America has sent countless desperate refugees fleeing across international borders in an attempt to avoid the horror and bloodshed. The go-to destinations for these refugees are American territories free from armed conflict such as Hawaii, Alaska, even Puerto Rico. Countless others have fled to Canada due to their stable political climate and compatible cultures. Others have made a break for Mexico, Cuba or even Ireland. However a select few have tried to take up residence in none other than the Dominion of Newfoundland. At only a stone's throw from American Shores, the first boats of Refugees first washed up in the weeks following the outbreak of hostilities. The American Refugees, unfamiliar with the Economic hurdles faced by Newfoundland, were reportedly appalled by the destitute economic conditions and generally bleak atmosphere; with some Yankee refugees also being put off by the 'Incomprehensible' local accents. In what was even more of a shock, several refugees who departed for Newfoundland's shores found themselves fleeing not long after; either changing their destination to Canada proper, or deciding that bearing it in the war-torn United States was a better option than Newfoundland. The Government has secretly expressed relief that the Refugees are seeking alternative locations, as Newfoundland currently has neither the resources nor the ability to handle a refugee crisis."

nfl_flavour.3.t:0 "An Incident on the High Seas"
nfl_flavour.3.d:0 "Relations between the Union of Britain and the Kingdom of Canada are tense, to say the least. Trade between the two nations is virtually nonexistent, with the limited commerce between the two nations being closely regulated at all times. This tension has been at the source of a recent confrontation between two ships in the Empire's waters. The SS Sagona, a civilian vessel owned by the Reid Newfoundland Company and used as a ferry between Newfoundland and the northern coast of Labrador was sunk today by a Canadian Vessel which mistook them for a Union of Britain patrol ship. The source of the confusion stemmed from the ensign flown by the Ship, that being the flag of the Dominion of Newfoundland. Newfoundland, unlike their cousins in the now-former Dominion of Canada did switch their iconic Red Ensign to a Blue one to avoid confusion with the Union of Britain, which flew a Red flag which bore a striking similarity to the Empire's trademark Red Banner.\n\n This tragic incident has once more sparked a debate within the House of Assembly on the fate of Newfoundland's flag, with many calling on [NFL.GetLeader] to change our flag to avoid such incidents in the future.\n\n Regardless of their choice, the RCN has offered a formal apology to the Government of Newfoundland for their awful mistake, and has promised to compensate the Reid company for their lost ship. "
