### Events ###
url.1.t: "The Ural Cossack Host"
url.1.d: "In late 1917, units of the Ural Cossack troops that had been deployed on the front lines returned to their homeland. Despite the Bolsheviks' vigorous efforts to disarm them, the majority of these units returned with their weapons intact. The economic, political, and spiritual values of the Ural Cossacks clashed sharply with the directives imposed by the newly established Soviet government.\n\nUnlike other Cossack groups, the Ural Cossacks did not experience generational conflicts or social stratification based on property ownership. These factors prevented the Bolsheviks from attempting to attract the Cossacks through promises of land concessions. Quite to the contrary, the Soviet government withdrew from the Cossacks was their exclusive fishing rights in the Ural River basin. In March 1918, the Cossacks disbanded the Bolshevik revolutionary committees in their area and destroyed the punitive forces dispatched to quell the uprising, establishing the Ural Military Administration. In 1919, the Cossacks of the lower Ural elected a leader, Lieutenant General Vladimir Tolstov, a native of Guryev. Under Tolstov's leadership, the Cossack forces formed the core of the Ural Army, which joined the ranks of Kolchak's troops.\n\nThe Ural Cossacks tenaciously defended their territory, occasionally inflicting significant losses on the Red Army, but their efforts were hindered by dwindling mobilization resources, mounting casualties, lack of provisions, and an acute shortage of advanced weapons such as artillery and machine guns. Fortunately, they were eventually able to link up with Kolchak's forces and the remnants of the Komuch People's Army, securing their position and pushing back the Bolshevik advance."
url.1.a: "What next?"

url.2.t: "The Ural Cossack Host"
url.2.d: "Following the conclusion of the Civil War, the Ural Cossack Host became part of the Alash Autonomy, as the newly established government in Petrograd prioritized national identity over all others. The Cossacks likewise gained autonomy but remained legally responsible to the Alash administration. Therefore, the Russian authorities endeavored to maintain control over the Steppe, yet in reality, the Cossacks failed to comply with the directives of the Alash Orda. This became particularly evident after the 1925 Kolchak Putsch, during which most Cossack forces initially supported the insurrection.\n\nThe Ural Cossacks, characterized by their reluctance to collaborate with the Alash government and their insistence on maintaining their own autonomy, operated as a self-governing entity, effectively operating outside the realm of legal regulation. With the backing of the Russian General Staff, they were able to maintain their existence in a somewhat altered form. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that the status quo needs to be reevaluated, and if the Ural Cossacks are to continue existing, it must be as something distinct from the Kazakh state."
url.2.a: "We are the Ural Cossacks!"

url.3.t: "Kazakh Self-Government in [1212.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
url.3.d: "Following the dissolution of the feeble Kazakh state into internal strife, we were compelled to finally sever our ties with this quasi-entity. However, it was not merely our ancestral territories that came under our control, but also the vast steppe on the eastern bank of the Ural River, which was predominantly inhabited by Kazakhs and, during the Tsarist era, was also part of the Uralsk Oblast.\n\nDuring the civil unrest, local Kazakhs, led by Jahansha Dosmukhamedov, firmly established themselves in these areas, declaring the establishment of the independent \"Uil Vilayat\" entity and claiming the right to represent the entirety of the Alash Orda. Dosmukhamedov subsequently consolidated his influence within the local populace, maintaining unwavering popularity and influence throughout this period.\n\nThis is the reason why our territories have not been fully under our jurisdiction. Despite the Ataman's covetous gaze upon these lands, they now fall under the governance of local Kazakhs who have hastened to proclaim their own \"autonomy\". Moreover, these Kazakhs are openly engaging in conflict with us, intent on seizing all the \"arbitrarily selected\" grazing lands on the left bank of the Ural River. It is imperative that we bring an end to this hostility as swiftly as possible."
url.3.a: "Now we're in charge!"

url.4.t: "Hostility Between Two Families"
url.4.d: "Ataman Tolstov has served as the uninterrupted leader of the Ural Cossacks for nearly two decades. During this period, the Ural Cossacks evolved into a bastion of conservatism, amassing substantial wealth through fishing and oil leases, but at a cost of the burgeoning fortune of their Ataman. He skillfully navigated the situation to emerge as the primary beneficiary.\n\nNaturally, this development could not fail to ignite discontent among some sections of the Cossack community. According to those in opposition, Tolstov was a figure who nearly dismantled the Ural Host during the Civil War, refusing collaboration with other anti-Bolshevik factions, effectively operating as an uncontrollable feudal warlord. Having consolidated power in his own hands and those of his extended family, the Tolstovs thrived throughout this period, as did their allies. On the other side, the influential Borodin family remained a prominent presence.\n\nMikhail Borodin, a representative of liberal views, had personally refused the position of Ataman in 1917. He advocated cooperation with both the Komuch and the People’s Army, hoping for universal democratization, and openly opposed the Ataman and turned other Cossack leaders against him.\n\nIt is now clear that Tolstov has complete control over the situation. According to Tolstov's plan, Borodin must be arrested while the opportunity exists — and there is reason to believe that this will happen. Some members of the Ataman's inner circle opposed this decision, fearing possible unrest among the Cossacks. However, the final decision rests with Tolstov."
url.4.a: "Arrest Borodin!"
url.4.b: "There is no need to stir up trouble."

url.5.t: "Confrontation With Tolstov?"
url.5.d: ""
url.5.a: "We need Ural Cossacks on our side."
url.5.b: "We have to recognize status-quo."

url.6.t: "Coup in Uralsk"
url.6.d: "In Uralsk today, the conflict between two powerful families reached a climax as Mikhail Borodin, backed by a contingent of Ural Cossacks and Dutov, the ataman of Orenburg Cossacks, mobilized his forces against Vladimir Tolstov, another ataman. Skirmishes erupted in the streets of Uralsk as fierce battles raged for strategic positions. Tolstov, taken by surprise and lacking adequate support, found himself in a precarious position. Within a matter of hours, Borodin's forces overcame Tolstov's supporters, and Tolstov himself was captured. In an effort to prevent further bloodshed, he agreed to resign and depart Uralsk under armed guard. Borodin, now in control, swiftly consolidated his position."
url.6.a: "Will the things change now?"

url.7.t: "Coup in Uralsk"
url.7.d: "In Uralsk today, the conflict between two powerful families reached a climax as Mikhail Borodin, backed by a contingent of Ural Cossacks and our ataman Dutov, mobilized his forces against Vladimir Tolstov, another Ataman. Skirmishes erupted in the streets of Uralsk as fierce battles raged for strategic positions. Tolstov, taken by surprise and lacking adequate support, found himself in a precarious position.

url.8.d: "Following the personal contribution of Ataman Dutov to the triumph of our new Ataman, his government officially acknowledged Borodin, and our leaders, in a personal meeting in Orenburg, executed an act of non-belligerence, acknowledging mutual boundaries, and, most importantly, deliberated on a strategy for countering Russia's adversaries. Now, with our unity fortified, the Cossacks once again stand united in their patriotic sentiments."
url.8.a: "Glory to Borodin and Dutov!"

url.9.t: "Borodin's Flight"
url.9.d: ""
url.9.a: "Now we are not afraid of the opposition."

url.10.t: "Dictatorship of Tolstov"
url.10.d: "Today we have received information that Mikhail Borodin, a Cossack and a friend of ours, as well as the leader of the opposing Cossack faction against Ataman Tolstov, has escaped from Uralsk, fearing arrest. Ataman Tolstov has been in power since 1918 and has repeatedly demonstrated his treachery towards Russia and the Cossack cause by openly refusing to assist and support the Allied forces. During the post-war period, he amassed a personal fortune through his involvement in the oil and fishing trades, thereby enhancing his influence, yet failing to extend even a momentary assistance to others. With the flight of Borodin, it appears that we have completely lost our foothold among the Ural Cossacks."
url.10.d2: "$url.10.d$ However, there is still hope. Ataman Dutov has proposed entering into negotiations with the Kazakh government on the left bank of the Ural, represented by Jahansha Dosmukhamedov, who opposes Tolstov and aims to gain full control over their grazing lands and territories in general. It is possible that in exchange for their assistance, we could establish an anti-Bolshevik alliance with them."

In response to this act of treachery, the leader proposes to sever all ties with Dutov and impose trade sanctions on them."

The purpose of this meeting was not only to discuss the situation but also to devise a strategy for action. Given the universal and unwavering hatred for what the Cossacks refer to as \"Bolshevism\", which they believe is the root cause of Russia's current troubles, a group of warmongers proposed declaring war on this evil entity, which they see as a threat to Russia's very existence.\n\nAt the official level, it was suggested recognizing [RVA.GetLeader]'s government as the sole legitimate authority and immediately entering into conflict. However, this proposal did not garner unanimous support. Some members of the circle argued that the Ural Host should not become embroiled in this conflict for the sake of its own people, as the war had not yet reached their territories. They proposed waiting until it did, then defending their lands as the defending party."
