BAN_ELENA_BACALOGLU_DESC:0 "From one heralding from Bucharest, it is odd to see a woman such as Elena Bacaloglu now leading a Banatian state, ripped straight from the Habsburg vices. However, her story stretches far beyond the confines of Romania.\n\nBorn in 1878 with numerous brothers, Bacaloglu distinguished herself in the fields of education and was quickly enthralled with Romanian symbolism by her second husband, Ovid Densusianu. Though this marriage, too, did not last, Bacaloglu moved to the Kingdom of Italy in the decade leading up to the Weltkrieg, continuing to refine her writing and contacts with the wider Romanian literary sphere.\nWhen the Weltkrieg broke out in Italy, Bacaloglu turned to campaign for Romanian intervention, supporting the inclusion of Transylvania into a Greater Romania and perhaps even a Latin Federation. She played a large role in the creation of Romanian legions to fight in Italy, known for her activism and zeal in the Romanianist cause. After the battle of Caporetto in 1917, Bacaloglu relocated to Genoa, and the subsequent few years of slow Austrian advances worried her greatly. To these ends she remained in Genoa, looking to the Aromanians, Istro-Romanians, and Megleno-Romanians to perhaps reincite the Romanian cause. However, with the end of the Weltkrieg and an Italian defeat, her political tirades and activism were slowly shut out by the growing crisis in Italy.\n\nBacaloglu, strangely, next moved to the city of Fiume and connected with Istro-Romanian writer Andrei Glavina, also acquainting with the secretive band of Italian Arditi in Fiume.\n\nHere, in tandem with the Iron Guard movement in her native Romania, Bacaloglu and her Italian husband then turned to domestic resistance and had Istro-Romanian detachments of legionnaires working with the Irredentista.\n\nThis period ended some time after the Fiume Compromise, when Governor Horthy came to power - as the Arditi was cracked down on, Bacaloglu took her experiences and fled to Banat, returning to her roots and taking many lessons from the time spent with Bacci, D'Annunzio, and the Irredentista. Forming her own band of revolutionaries, the Îndrăzneti, she set to work to overthrow Austro-Hungarian control from the inside. She remains in contact with the Fiumeans to this day, and vows to bring a Greater Romania to fruition by any means possible, no matter how much blood must be shed."
