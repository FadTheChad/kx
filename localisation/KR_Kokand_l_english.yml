### Events ###

kyr.intro.t: "Turbulent 1917"
kyr.intro.d: "In the wake of the February Revolution in Russia, the political landscape of Central Asia underwent significant upheaval, mirroring the events unfolding in the larger Russian empire. Turkestan found itself at a critical crossroad, torn between national liberal social organizations and predominantly Russian congresses of the Soviets. On November 28, 1917, the All-Turkestan Qurultai of Muslims was convened under the leadership of the liberal-democratic Shuro-i-Islamiya party. In a historic proclamation, Turkestan autonomy was declared as part of the Federal Russia.\n\nHowever, the young Turkestan autonomy faced immediate challenges, marked by a fierce confrontation between various political currents involved in its formation, most notably between the Jadids and Qadimists. As the influence of the Qadimists gained momentum, it led to the resignation of the first premier, Tynyshpayev, followed by the overthrow of Shokai in February 1918. The clash between these ideological forces laid the foundation for an impending civil war that threatened the stability and future of the newly born republic."
kyr.intro.a: "Interesting."

kyr.200.t: "The Fall of Bolshevik Power in Turkestan"
kyr.200.d: "In the summer of 1918, the Turkestan Soviet Republic found itself cut off from Soviet Russia as the flames of the Civil War engulfed the region. Isolated and facing numerous challenges, the once-dominant Bolshevik methods proved ineffective in maintaining control over Turkestan. The failure of Soviet Russia to provide much-needed support left the region vulnerable, and those opposing the regime began to seize the opportunity to strengthen their forces.\n\nDuring the Askhabad Mutiny, a Trans-Caspian Provisional Government emerged, backed by the British mission, further weakening the grip of the Bolsheviks. This newfound opposition found allies in various quarters. In November 1918, the Fergana Peasant Army, led by Monstrov and comprising volunteer units of peasant settlers, rallied against the Bolsheviks in Jalalabad. In Tashkent, in January 1919, a rebellion orchestrated by the military commissar Osipov resulted in the loss of many lives of Soviet workers.\n\nAs the year progressed, opposition forces united against the Bolsheviks. The Peasant Army, Madamin Bey Mojahedin, and the Semirechye Army Cossacks joined hands, culminating in the formation of the Provisional Fergana Government. The relentless resistance led to the eventual overthrow of Bolshevik power in Turkestan. The Provisional Fergana Government, in a moment of historic significance, declared the restoration of the Turkestan Republic and the end of the oppressive dictatorships that once held sway over the region."
kyr.200.a: "What's next?"

kyr.201.t: "Turkestan Military Organisation"
kyr.201.d: "In February 1918, the Turkestan Military Organization (TVO) emerged as a clandestine anti-Bolshevik group, founded by former officers of the Tsarist army, Russian intellectuals, and former officials. Nicknamed the White Guard of Turkestan, the TVO played a significant role in defeating the Bolsheviks during the Turkestan Civil War. The organization received active assistance from foreign intelligence agents, primarily the British, with figures like Wilfred Malleson and agents operating under the guise of foreign diplomatic missions accredited in Tashkent under the Soviet government.\n\nMembers of this underground organization established connections with Ataman Dutov, General Denikin, Alash Orda Kazakhs, the Emir of Bukhara, leaders of Fergana and Turkmen Mujahideen, Transcaspian White Guard forces, and English consuls in Kashgar, Kulja, and Meshed. Konstantin Osipov, a former Bolshevik who staged a rebellion against his own in January 1919, the peasant army of Konstantin Monstrov, and the Madamin-Bek's Mujahideen - all became mere pawns in the cunning game of the Turkestan Military Organization.\n\nThe leader of the organization, Pyotr Kornilov, brother of the Russian military commander Lavr Kornilov, though perished, leaving a power vacuum within the organization. In this void, Osipov and Monstrov, former ideological opponents, joined forces for a common goal, gaining the upper hand. Meanwhile, Madamin-Bek also played a crucial role in the organization, but it is clear that this triumvirate will not willingly share power if they manage to seize it - and they most certainly will try..."
kyr.201.a: "The most interesting"

kyr.1.t: "Crisis in the Turkestan Federal Republic"
kyr.1.d: "In 1920, the Turkestan Federal Republic emerged following agreements between Russia and the Provisional Fergana Government. The restoration of the Prime Minister's post saw Mustafa Shokai taking the helm, accompanied by the establishment of a parliamentary body known as the Qurultai and the formation of a new government. Despite these efforts, Russia's control over Turkestan proved untenable, leading to the eventual withdrawal of Russian troops from the region. In 1926, Kerensky recognized the independence of the Turkestan Republic, marking a critical turning point in the nation's history.\n\nUnder Mustafa Shokai's leadership as Minister-President, the Turkestan Federal Republic attempted to navigate the complexities of a country grappling with internal problems. Despite its liberal-leaning regime in comparison to its neighbor, the Emirate of Bukhara, the Turkestan Federal Republic faced mounting challenges that threatened its stability.\n\nFor the past 16 years, Shokai has struggled to hold together a nation on the verge of disintegration. A fragile coalition government between the Jadhidists and Qadhimists has been fraught with internal dissent, and in the East Pamirs, a Mujahedeen uprising has erupted, adding to the nation's woes. On another front, the pan-Turkist socialist movement ERK is gaining popularity, further complicating the political landscape."
kyr.1.a: "Interesting."

kyr.2.t: "Riots in East Pamir Escalate!"
kyr.2.d: "The tranquil mountain region of East Pamir is gripped by chaos as the Mujahideen divisions launch a violent uprising against our Jadidist rule. In an attempt to discredit our government, these insurgents have resorted to heinous acts of robbery and murder, causing widespread fear and instability among the local populace. The situation demands urgent attention and decisive action to quell the insurgency before it engulfs the entire region.\n\nAs reports of the Mujahideen's actions continue to escalate, suspicions arise that the Bukharan Karaul-begi, Ibrahim-Bek, may be behind this unrest. His clandestine support to the insurgents has emboldened their cause, making it even more imperative to swiftly crush the insurgency and restore peace to the troubled region.\n\nWith the forthcoming elections looming on the horizon, the insurgency poses a serious threat to the integrity of the democratic process. Should we fail to effectively deal with the unrest, the very foundation of our government could be compromised. The legitimacy of the elections may come under scrutiny, and there may be calls for them to be canceled or, at the very least, postponed until order is restored."
kyr.2.a: "Reinforce our Guard there."

kyr.3.t: "Clashes Between Army and Mujahideen"
kyr.3.d: "The rebels in the East Pamir region had attempted to engage into armed conflict with our army, fighting back and entrenching in the mountains. It seems that we cannot break through their blockade without additional support from the Centre and if we don't do something, they will sit in the mountains and shoot our soldiers."
kyr.3.a: "We must reinforce!"

kyr.4.t: "East Pamir Mujahideen Request Help"
kyr.4.d: "The Turkestan government is now struggling to deal with the revolt in East Pamir region, the insurgency of the local Mujahideen divisions, trying to overthrow the democratic government in all of Turkestan.\n\nNow they have addressed the Emir and Kashbegi in order to receive some support in weapons and ammunition to fight back the Turkestan government.\n\nWe can fund their operations and hope that they will effectively fight against Turkestan, however, some of the Emir's advisors believe that this is can be exposed by the Turkestan government, which can lead to a major political scandal and the aggravation of relations between our countries.\n\nThe Kashbegi, on the other hand, believes that we should support any force that fights against pro-Russian government."
kyr.4.a: "Fund the East Pamir Mujahideen!"
kyr.4.b: "We should not risk our ties with Turkestan."

kyr.100.t: "Tensions Grow"
kyr.100.d: "As in many other cities of the former Russian Empire, the Russian population constituted a significant part of them. Turkestan was no exception, where our largest city and industrial center, Tashkent, has a significant Russian population. It is noteworthy that it was in Tashkent that the great Russian-chauvinist Turkestan Soviet Republic was formed, and it was from Tashkent that the last Russian troops were withdrawn. \n\nIn addition to the large cities, however, Russian settlers also made up a significant peasant population. It was they who formed the backbone of the Monstrov Peasant Army 20 years ago, and now they continue to live peacefully under the warm Turkestan sun.\n\nHowever, it's not all that simple. Recently, incidents of harassment of the Muslim population by the Russian-speaking population have become more frequent. According to the minister-chairman, all these clashes between non-Muslims and Muslims are initiated by Shuro-Ulema in order to unleash ethnic conflicts. But one cannot overlook the lawlessness of the Russian-speaking population, who must remember that here they are at best guests, at worst colonizers."
kyr.100.a: "We respect all our citizens."
kyr.100.b: "The Russians should know their place."

kyr.101.t: "Kadimists Demand Government Reshuffle"
kyr.101.d: ""
kyr.101.a: "Appoint a Kadimist minister."
kyr.101.b: "Current government is just fine."

kyr.102.t: "The End of Coalition"
kyr.102.d: ""
kyr.102.a: "An end of an era..."

kyr.103.t: "Madamin-Bek Coup"
kyr.103.d: ""
kyr.103.a: "The weak Shokay government shall no longer lead us."

kyr.104.t: "Clashes in East Pamir"
kyr.104.d: "With our government in complete disarray, the rebelling Mujahideen in East Pamir have engaged in open revolt against local militia. "
kyr.104.a: "We shall crush the Mujahideen!"
kyr.104.b: "Our leader, Kurshirmat, shall take the mantle!"

kyr.105.t: "Shokay Rises Democratic Forces in Tashkent!"
kyr.105.d: "Followed by an outright undemocratic military coup by Madamin-Bek and Shuro-Ulema, the exiled minister-president Shokay has now rallied his supporters in Tashkent in order to preserve democracy, or, at least, its illusion in Turkestan."\
kyr.105.a: "He had his chance and he lost it!"
kyr.105.b: "Democracy shall prevail!"

kyr.106.t: "Peasant Army Revolt!"
kyr.106.d: ""
kyr.106.a: "We won't tolerate russophiles here anymore!"
kyr.106.b: "Monstrov will end the chaos."

kyr.107.t: "Peasant Army Supports Shokay!"
kyr.107.d: ""
kyr.107.a: "How dare they!"
kyr.107.b: "We knew we could rely on them."

kyr.108.t: "Pishpek Alash Secedes!"
kyr.108.d: "The Pishpek department of the Alash party has declared the independence of Kyrgyzstan!"
kyr.108.a: "Another traitors!"

kyr.109.t: "ERK Party Mobilizes Socialists"
kyr.109.d: ""
kyr.109.a: "Tashkent is captured by ERK and Shokay's forced to flee"
kyr.109.b: "Socialists are surrounded and the uprising is crushed."

kyr.50.t: "Evidence on Bukharan Support of Rebels"
kyr.50.d: "We have exposed that the Emirate of Bukhara is sponsoring Mujahideen revolt in East Pamir by sending them ammunition and supplies. This is an absolute violation of political stability in the region and direct intervention into our internal affairs. The Kadimists suggest that we should immediately express a note of protest to the Emir and demand him to stop destabilizing our country. The Jadidists, however, suggested to act more resolutely and completely cut all ties with Bukhara, close the borders and brutally suppress the Mujahideen in East Pamir."
kyr.50.a: "Follow the Kadimist suggestion."
kyr.50.b: "We should listen to Shokay and cut all ties with Bukhara!"
kyr.50.c: "Are we sure that the evidence is enough?"

kyr.51.t: "Note of Protest From Turkestan!"
kyr.51.d: "The Turkestan Government has expressed a note of protest and accused us of violating stability in the region."
kyr.51.a: "Who cares?"

kyr.52.t: "Turkestan Cut All Ties With Us!"
kyr.52.d: "The Turkestan government has cut all ties with us after exposing that we are secretly supporting the East Pamir insurgency. Moreover, they promised that they will brutally suppress the revolt."
kyr.52.a: "Damn."

kyr.55.t: "Rebels Suppressed!"
kyr.55.d: "We managed to win against the Mujahideen in East Pamir and soon our National Guard has invaded the whole region to put it back under control of our government. The treacherous Kurbashi and their divisions have fled the country to Bukhara. At the same time the Kadimist party, Shuroy-Ulamo has lost much of the popular support for openly supporting the rebellion."
kyr.55.a: "Peace, finally!"

kyr.56.t: "National Guard Gives Up!"
kyr.56.d: "Our national guard was unable to crush the rebels and was forced to retreat, which allowed the Mujahideen to maintain the region under their control. It is said that tomorrow will be a holiday in Bukhara due to the victory of Mujahideen in East Pamir. Moreover, Shuroy-Islamiya has lost much of the popular support, because of our loss."
kyr.56.a: "Damn."

kyr.57.t: "Partial Control Over East Pamir"
kyr.57.d: "We managed to break the defense of the Mujahideen, but we could not establish our full control over the region. Though the 'East Pamir Government' is now in exile in Bukhara, there are still some partisans in the area."
kyr.57.a: "A great progress, at least."

kyr.58.t: "National Guard Gives Up!"
kyr.58.d: "The Turkestan National Guard was unable to crush us and was forced to retreat, allowing us to maintain the region under our control. Tomorrow there will be a holiday in Bukhara and East Pamir due to our victory!"
kyr.58.a: "This is only the beginning!"

kyr.59.t: "A Bitter Defeat!"
kyr.59.d: "The Turkestan National Guard managed to crush us and now they are invading the whole region. Our leaders were forced to flee for Bukhara, which means our complete defeat."
kyr.59.a: "Damn."

kyr.60.t: "Meeting of the Military Council: The Situation in the East Pamir"
kyr.60.d: "To combat the insurgency in the East Pamirs, the Minister-President convened a Military Council composed, so to speak, of high-ranking field leaders, including Madamin-Bek and Konstantin Monstrov, leaders of the now defunct Provisional Fergana Government. Representatives of Shuroy-Ulamo were also present at the Council. It was necessary to figure out how to stop the uprising as quickly as possible.\n\nHaving undergone a series of difficult discussions and debates, there are now two main points of view on how to win this conflict. The first is to mobilize more troops and invade the Eastern Pamirs in large numbers, hoping to outnumber the enemies with weapons and men. This was the option proposed by Madamin-Bek and Shuroy-Ulamo.\n\nThe second is to start their own guerrilla movement against the Mujahideen, infiltrating their fighters into their camp under the cover of loyal followers of the Mujahideen, and then launch a surprise attack from outside as well as inside. This is the tactic followed by the Monstrov."
kyr.60.a: "We should outnumber them."
kyr.60.b: "Infiltrate their movement."

kyr.61.t: "Another Loss"
kyr.61.d: "Despite we outnumbered the Mujahideen, they still managed to hold the region, meaning that this is another our defeat. With the elections upcoming, it seems that we cannot spare more resources to defeat them."
kyr.61.a: "That's awful."

kyr.62.t: "Mujahideen Defeated!"
kyr.62.d: "Due to our tactic of infiltration, we managed to break through the rebel's defence, while they were preoccupied with the resistance inside the region. We managed to get crush the revolt, finally bringing peace to East Pamir."
kyr.62.a: "Great!"

kyr.5.t: "Young Khiva Victory"
kyr.5.d: "There have been reports about the liberalisation of Khiva's regime. It seems that Mujahideen have lost their power in Khiva, becoming a serious threat to Mujahideen and Kadimist influence. It seems that now Shuroy-Ulamo can only rely on Bukhara."
kyr.5.a: "The Khanate has fallen."

kyr.6.t: "The Regime Changed in Bukhara"
kyr.6.d: "We have just received reports that our neighbor and rival in the Emirate of Bukhara have undergone a dramatic shift in their political climate. The Emir seems to finally given up and the rule of Mujahideen in Bukhara has ended."
kyr.6.a: "Finally, a friendly regime in Bukhara."
kyr.6.b: "We're the last true political force of the Steppes."

kyrelections.1.t: "The Upcoming Elections"
kyrelections.1.d: "The upcoming elections of 1936 are going to be one of the most uncertain in the history of the Turkestan Republic. On the one hand, incumbent president Mustafa Shokay, who has been in office since 1917, is the representative of the Jadidist party, Shuroy-Islamiya. He's a kazakh and seeks further cooperation with the Alash Autonomy, a position that has garnered him much hate among the common Kyrgyz and Uzbek population of the region; he is seen as a Russian lapdog and an Alash puppet. On the other hand, there is the candidate from the Kadimist party, Shuroy-Ulamo, Katta Ergash. He is a supporter of traditional values, and seeks cooperation with the Emirate of Bukhara. He also relies on Ottoman and German support and wishes to make Turkestan a part of a single pan-Islamic state.\n\nHowever, with some of the region under control of Mujahideen, the unrest can spread across the nation, and the fate of democracy is uncertain."
kyrelections.1.a: "Challenging."

kyrelections.2.t: "President's Speech"
kyrelections.2.d: "Mustafa Shokay, incumbent president, has delivered a speech just before the elections. He promised further cooperation with Russia and the Alash Autonomy, increasing representation of other nations in the parliament and openly denouncing the Kadimists and the Mujahideen, who, as he said, want to destroy the Republic and democracy and integrate our state into the Emirate of Bukhara. He added that the citizens of the Turkestan Republic should do everything they can to preserve the independence of the country."
kyrelections.2.a: "He's promising the same thing every time."

kyrelections.3.t: "Political Crisis in Russia"
kyrelections.3.d: "The assassination of Kerensky appeared to be a surprise for Mustafa Shokay. Now he cannot count on Russian assistance, and one of his main promises during his presidency cannot be implemented. This is a serious shock for his campaign and it seems that nothing can stop Shuroy-Ulamo from finally winning the elections."
kyrelections.3.a: "What will he do now?"

kyrelections.4.t: "ERK Agitation"
kyrelections.4.d: "The Socialist Party of Turkestan 'ERK' has launched a large-scale agitation for their party, calling for workers' and dehkans' solidarity against our rule. Why generally our allies in first afterwar years, the scattered anti-Bolshevik socialist groups and organisations soon united into a single party, led by Torokul Dzhanuzakov and Nazir Torekulov, former members of the Russian Left SR party, later joined by Ahmet Zeki Velidi Togan, a Bashkir nationalists, who left the Russia for Turkestan due to his panturkist views and Russification policies.\n\nNow, united, the ERK is ready to participate in elections to form a third significant force in our political spectrum, challenging both Shuroy-Islamiya and Shuroy-Ulamo.\n\nWhile generally Shokay opposed ERK in the previous elections, this time, perhaps, he should find a compromise and form a coalition with them in order to kick Shuroy-Ulamo out of the Mejlis."
kyrelections.4.a: "Interesting"

kyrelections.5.t: "Choosing the Focus"
kyrelections.5.d: "We should choose the regions where we should focus our agitation on. The first choice is to challenge the socialists in urban areas, mainly Tashkent. While this will possibly get us more supporters among the workers, it could also weaken our core electorate in Pishpek and Samarkand, who see socialism as too radical ideology.\n\nOn the other hand, we can focus on Kadimist-majority areas, such as Turkestan and East Pamir. This can weaken the Shuroy-Ulamo positions, but at the same time, we will lose some points against Socialists.\n\nFinally, we can turn to our core regions of Samarkand and Pishpek and hope that this time we will succeed."
kyrelections.5.a: "Focus on Tashkent and other urban areas."
kyrelections.5.b: "Focus on traditionally Kadimist regions."
kyrelections.5.c: "Focus on our core Jadidist regions."

kyrelections.6.t: "Coalition Talks with ERK"
kyrelections.6.d: "Our victory more and more is slipping out of our hands, and it seems that we must start thinking about coalition with ERK. While we have much in common, some of their ideology points are too radical for us, like land and religious reform. However, if we don't try we can lose the elections to Kadimists, who are likely to end any kind of democracy in Turkestan."
kyrelections.6.a: "Start the talks."
kyrelections.6.b: "We shall win alone."

kyrelections.7.t: "Shokay Meets Dzhanuzakov"
kyrelections.7.d: "President Shokay has met with ERK leader, Dzhanuzakov in a historical meeting to start coalition talks between Shuroy-Islamiya and ERK. While there are many differences between the parties, they all share the same hope for Turkestan Democracy. It is unknown if the parties will agree to cooperate, but the first step has already been made.\n\nThe one hot topic on the talks is the Land Reform, which, according to the ERK party programme, should be nationalized, and the agriculture should be collectivized, which is not tolerated by any of the Shuroy-Islamiya members and can greatly dissapoint our liberal supporters.\n\nThe second most important topic is the freedom of strikes and trade unions, which was not under ban, though harshly suppressed by the Government in the previous years."
kyrelections.7.a: "We should try to agree on Land Reform."
kyrelections.7.b: "We should try to agree on Strikes and Trade-Unions."
kyrelections.7.c: "Let's focus on something irrelevant now: Religion and Socialism."

kyrelections.8.t: "Land Reform Debate"
kyrelections.8.d: "Decided to focus on the Land Reform, the talks were indeed hot, with each of the sides evaluating two principled positions where the coalition can exist. The ERK has suggested either to nationalize all the land in Turkestan, which will definetely anger most of our supporters, but greatly liberalize the dehkans and workers, or collectivize the agricultural sector. The Shuroy-Islamiya should either agree on one of the principles, or suggest a compromise: voluntary collectivisation. While also not very popular among Shuroy-Islamiya voters, the voluntary collectivisation can be really the way out of the crisis."
kyrelections.8.a: "We agree on nationalization of land."
kyrelections.8.b: "We agree on collectivization of agriculture."
kyrelections.8.c: "We agree only on voluntary collectivisation."
kyrelections.8.e: "We don't agree - leave the talks!"

kyrelections.9.t: "Turkestan National Union Announced!"
kyrelections.9.d: "With negotiations passing smoothly, Shuroy-Islamiya and ERK have agreed on voluntary collectivisation and created a coalition that will likely succeed in the upcoming elections and win against Kadimists. The Turkestan National Union, receiving the title after the ERK's initial party name, should become the favorite or the democracy has no chance."
kyrelections.9.a: "Great victory for our fragile democracy!"

kyrelections.10.t: "Coalition Talks Disrupted!"
kyrelections.10.d: "The negotiations were disrupted by the unwilingness of any of the two parties to cooperate. While the ERK's position is clear, the Shuroy-Islamiya, which is in a weaker position, is risking to lose the elections and our fragile democracy can fall."
kyrelections.10.a: "Disaster!"

kyrelections.11.t: "Trade-Unions Debate"
kyrelections.11.d: "Decided to focus on the strikes and trade-unions state, the talks were indeed hot, with each of the sides evaluating their principled positions where the coalition can exist. The ERK has suggested that the right to strike and create trade unions should be guaranteed by the government and the rights of dehkans and workers should be respected. While Shuroy-Islamiya can agree on this point, though losing some support from more conservative-minded electorate, it seems there is no compromise available for this point. If we don't agree on this topic, we can fail coalition talks."
kyrelections.11.a: "Guarantee the right to strike and form trade unions."
kyrelections.11.b: "That's enough - leave the talks!"

kyrelections.12.t: "Turkestan National Union Announced!"
kyrelections.12.d: "With negotiations passing smoothly, Shuroy-Islamiya and ERK have agreed on guaranteeing the right to strike and form trade unions, thus creating a coalition that will likely succeed in the upcoming elections and win against Kadimists. The Turkestan National Union, receiving the title after the ERK's initial party name, should become the favorite or the democracy has no chance."
kyrelections.12.a: "Great victory for our fragile democracy!"

kyrelections.13.t: "Election Day!"
kyrelections.13.d: "The day of elections has come and now we should provide safety to all the voters and check that the election was fair. The most dangerous electoral region is, of course, in Turkestan and East Pamir, where we can risk that the elections can be disrupted by the Mujahideen."
kyrelections.13.a: "Reinforce our south-eastern regions."

kyrelections.14.t: "Mujahideen Block Polling Stations!"
kyrelections.14.d: "As predicted, the Mujahideen troops in Turkestan and East Pamir have blocked the polling stations, preventing the population from exercising their legitimate constitutional right to vote. We should immediately deal with this situation, or else the elections cannot be considered legitimate and valid."
kyrelections.14.a: "Arrest all who block the polling stations!"
kyrelections.14.b: "Cancel the elections until we deal with them!"
kyrelections.14.c: "Announce our electoral victory even without Turkestan and East Pamir."

kyrelections.15.t: "Chaos in East Pamir"
kyrelections.15.d: "We managed to 'liberate' the polling station from Mujahideen in Turkestan, our capital city, but not in the East Pamir, where the Mujahideen have already blocked most of the polling station and declared the elections unconstitutional and illegitimate. If we don't do something now, we can anger the population."
kyrelections.15.a: "That's enough. Send National Guard to East Pamir!"
kyrelections.15.b: "Cancel the elections until we deal with them!"
kyrelections.15.c: "Announce our electoral victory even without East Pamir."

kyrelections.16.t: "Elections Postponed!"
kyrelections.16.d: "Due to the unstable situation in East Pamir, the government decided to temporary cancel the elections and postpone them until the unrest is dealt with. However, by trying to save the population's right to vote, we only angered them and showed our weakness. More people are joining the side of the Mujahideen, tired of our fragile democracy and the Kadimists have as well announced their support for the East Pamir rioters, completely debasing our political system!"
kyrelections.16.a: "Catastrophic!"

kyrelections.17.t: "Clashes in East Pamir"
kyrelections.17.d: "With our National Guard entering East Pamir, the armed clashes between them and Mujahideen bursted out. Moreover, the Kadimists announced their support for the Mujahideen, leaving us without support of almost half of the Mejlis. President Shokay, while he is still president, should do something, probably even enacting the martial law to save democracy."
kyrelections.17.a: "National Guard will deal with the unrest."
kyrelections.17.b: "Enact the martial law."

kyrelections.18.t: "Part of the National Guard Defects!"
kyrelections.18.d: "Part of the National Guard, being formed and raised by the Mujahideen has defected to their side, leaving us with minority of forces in the region. It seems that the catastrophe cannot be avoided... we should enact martial law and get ready for the worst."

kyrelections.26.d: "Despite our efforts to end the crisis, it had only escalated more just for our government to realize that people are mobilizing against our rule.\n\nThe Socialists were able to successfully seize control of a major industrial center, Tashkent, and also fixed their positions in the Ak-Mechet. Part of the National Guard, loyal to the president, was able to defend Samarkand and Pishpek, although it turned out to be divided, and the Mujahideen were firmly entrenched in the East Pamir.\n\nThere were some clashes between the opponents, the main goal of the attackers was to seize key infrastructure and railways. Despite the complexity of the situation, as a result of the chaos, the strengths and weaknesses of each side quickly became clear.

Luckily for them, the uprising was crushed, but unfortunately for us, Fayzulla Khodjaev has crossed the border and is now hiding somewhere in Samarkand.

kyr.9.t: "Socialist Insurgency in Ak-Mechet"
kyr.9.d: "It was stupid to think that the socialist movement in Turkestan was weak. Formally, the Union of Muslim Workers is represented by Nazir Torekulov in Turkestan, but he's unlikely to be a big threat. However, with the arrival of Mukhitdinov, he has managed to raise an uprising in the industrial region of Tashkent."
kyr.9.a: "Send there troops."

kyr.10.t: "Mukhitdinov Proclaims Workers' Republic in Tashkent"
kyr.10.d: "Abdulkadyr Mukhitdinov has proclaimed a socialist republic in Tashkent. While the idea is seemingly nonsensical and absurd, it has still occurred nonetheless. He's still a threat and he's supported by many proletarians in both Tashkent and our borders, we must remain vigilant."
kyr.10.a: "Liquidate the unrest at any cost."
kyr.10.b: "Ask Bukhara for help."

kyr.11.t: "Turkestan Asks for Help"
kyr.11.d: "The government of Turkestan has asked us to intervene in Tashkent and help to liquidate the socialist unrest in the border region.

kyr.11.b: "A destabilized Turkestan is better for us."

kyr.12.t: "Bukhara Intervenes in Tashkent."
kyr.12.d: "The government of [BUH.GetNameDef] has agreed to intervene in Tashkent. Our joint forces have liquidated the unrest with their joint strength. Luckily, Mukhitdinov was also murdered in the crossfire and the uprising was finally suppressed."
kyr.12.a: "Victory!"

kyr.13.t: "Bukhara Refused to Intervene."
kyr.13.d: "Bukhara’s administration has refused to intervene and help us to liquidate the socialist rebels. Left alone, it will be harder for us to suppress the uprising, but we must try lest our brave and proud democracy succumb to chaos."
kyr.13.a: "At least we tried, we march alone."

kyr.14.t: "Socialists Crushed"
kyr.14.d: "We managed to crush socialist rabble rousers once and for all. Instigator of the uprising, Abdulkadyr Mukhitdinov, has been slain by our forces in the fighting and it seems nothing can stop us now from achieving our goals."
kyr.14.a: "Victory!"

kyr.15.t: "Mukhitdinov Overthrows the Government."
kyr.15.d: "The protesters not only managed to repulse our forces, but many of our soldiers refused to fire on the protesters, instead joining their ranks. The uprising was supported in Pishkek as well, and it became too much for our regime to bear. The revolutionaries, spewing forth from Tashkent, seized administrative buildings in Pishkek and Osh, and Mukhitdinov arrived in the capital. Later that day he proclaimed the People's Republic of Turkestan."

kyr.16.d: "The [TRK.GetAdjective] forces have used the moment of [ALO.GetAdjective] weakness to start a sudden invasion of Zhetisu region, which has been their claim since 1918. The forces of [ALO.GetName] had to retreat and capitulate, leaving the whole region of Zhetisu a free real estate."
kyr.16.a: "Our terrible defeat!"
kyr.16.b: "We have finally done this!"

kyr.17.t: "[ALO.GetName] Upholds Zhetisu!"
kyr.17.d: "Despite the [TRK.GetAdjective] forces have used the moment of [ALO.GetAdjective] weakness to start a sudden invasion of Zhetisu region, which has been their claim since 1918, they never managed to break the defence of [ALO.GetName], which had secured the whole region of Zhetisu under their control."

kyr.19.t: "[FROM.GetName] Invaded Aralsk!"
kyr.19.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] forces has claimed that our government is not legitimate and, therefore, they no longer respect that we hold their 'core' territories. Yesterday they have occupied the Aralsk region, which was their claim since 1918. However, it seems that there is nothing we can do, at least for now."
kyr.19.a: "We should have never trusted them."

kyr.22.t: "Verniy Conference"
kyr.22.d: "The representatives of the [FROM.GetName] has arrived today in Verniy in order to suggest to hold the conference about the future of two our states. The main topic to be discussed is our current borders. To be more precise, disputed territories.\n\nThe [FROM.GetAdjective] government since its independence in 1918 has claimed the territory of Aralsk and the whole region of Zhetisu, from the Verniy city up to the lake Balkhash.\n\nIf we will be able to agree on disputed territories and finally end this topic, the relations between our countries will definetely improve.\n\nHowever, we can just leave the conference and leave this territories under our control, having worsened the relationship, but at least showing that we will fight for every Kazakh."
kyr.22.a: "Let us talk."
kyr.22.b: "Send them back - we won't give up our territory."

kyr.23.t: "Verniy Conference"
kyr.23.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to hold the conference and discuss disputed territories.\n\nIn fact, there is no much we can ask for. The most important our claim is the whole region of Zhetisu, which covers large amount of territory from Verniy city to the lake Balkhash. It is hard to believe that the Kazakhs will give up the whole region, where the majority of population is Kazakh. In response, however, we can guarantee their independence, the represenation of the Kazakh population in the Mejlis and even look forward to uniting our states into a single federation.\n\nThe second our claim is the north-eastern shore of the Aral Sea with a little town of Aralsk. Our government believes it to become a large sea port one day, moreover, located at the Central Asian Railway.\n\nThere is always a chance that the Kazakh government won't agree on any our term, but we will try to appease them as we can."
kyr.23.a: "Zhetisu in exchange for guarantees."
kyr.23.b: "Aralsk. Forget about Zhetisu."
kyr.23.c: "Demand both for guarantees."

kyr.24.t: "Zhetisu For Guarantees"
kyr.24.d: "The [FROM.GetLeader] has approached us with an offer. We should transfer the whole region of Zhetisu to them and in exchange we will guarantee independence of each other, sign military alliance and the [FROM.GetAdjective] government guarantees the representation of all Kazakh population.\n\nWhile this suggestion can seem ridiculuos at first, if we really want to unite our countries into a single state one day - this can be the first step towards it."
kyr.24.a: "What? Truly ridiculuos!"
kyr.24.b: "Hold on. This sounds reasonable!"
kyr.24.c: "Let ask the population instead."

kyr.25.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
kyr.25.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has expectedly refused our offer. It seems that they will never cede peacefully the whole region of Zhetisu. We can consider the Conference failed or try to at least negotiate for Aralsk."
kyr.25.a: "No chances. Leave the conference."
kyr.25.b: "Let us try to negotiate for Aralsk."

kyr.26.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
kyr.26.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has unexpectedly agreed to cede Zhetisu. It seems that it will become the unprecedented case of first peaceful territory transfer in Central Asia. Due to all formalities, the region will be fully transfered in several weeks."
kyr.26.a: "Splendid!"

kyr.27.t: "The Verniy Treaty"
kyr.27.d: "All preparations are now finished. The treaty of Verniy has been signed by both sides as well as ratified. The [FROM.GetName] has withdrawn its military from the region and the population of Zhetisu has been registered as [ROOT.GetNameDef] citizens and voters."
kyr.27.a: "Let us celebrate this!"

kyr.28.t: "[FROM.GetName] Suggest the Referendum"
kyr.28.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to cede Zhetisu only if the local population will vote for this. This is a clever move, which shows that the [FROM.GetName] cares about their citizens. We may respect their suggestion, but at the same time, if we fear that the population won't vote for joining us, we can refuse."
kyr.28.a: "That's a great idea."

kyr.30.c: "No chances. End the conference."

kyr.31.t: "[FROM.GetName] Claims the Referendum Was Rigged!"
kyr.31.d: "To our great surprise, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has claimed that the referendum was rigged. There is no way this can be true, as we had no access to the voting. Moreover, they have suggested to hold the referendum themselves, which makes no sense. It seems that the [FROM.GetAdjective] government just does not want to recognize the results and are rudely interfering into people's will."
kyr.31.a: "Demand they respect the people."
kyr.31.b: "No way, let us try to negotiate for Aralsk."

kyr.34.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] representatives believe that the region of Aralsk, the north-eastern shore of the Aral Sea should belong to them. This is a small region with a small population and without any valuable resources. However, the town of Aralsk has a potential of becoming a large port in the future and a fishing site. In general, our government believes that it is a small price for friendship."
kyr.34.a: "Alright. Let them have it."

kyr.39.t: "[FROM.GetName] Asks for Aralsk and Zhetisu"
kyr.39.d: "Without any doubt, our government was outraged by the [FROM.GetAdjective] 'offer'. Even if we get closer relations and mutual guarantees, ceding almost third of our territory is definetely not the best way. We can still agree, but our population won't like this."
