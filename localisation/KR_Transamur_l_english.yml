### Leaders & Traits ###

POLITICS_KYRIL_ROMANOV_TRM_DESC: "By the Grace of God, We, Kirill I, Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias, Tsar of Siberia; all of the northern countries Master; and others, and others, and others."
POLITICS_KAZEMBEK_DESC: "Little would have predicted that Alexander Kazembek would end up in the position he is in today. It seems as if his life may just be a lesson on the instability of the universe; of the chaos of politics and human existence. Born to a noble Iranian-Azerbaijani family, Kazembek saw the brunt of the Russian Revolution; something that undoubtably shaped his eccentric political views. However, instead of turning him against the Soviets, the Revolution endeared in him a certain level of respect for the Soviet System. And even though the Red Revolution failed; Kazembek still incorporated parts of the Soviet Ideals into his personal politics. \n\n His Charisma and experience as an Orator put him at the forefront of the new “Young Russia” group, a group that rejected Reactionary Tsarism in favour of a “New and Dynamic Vision”. As the situation in Russia deteriorated, Professor Nikolai Ustryalov convinced Party Secretary Kazembek to side with Alexander Kolchak and his coup against the Petrograd Government. Kolchak’s coup however failed; resulting in the creation of the state of Transamur; the rump state where Kazembek and Ustryalov fled to. These series of events led to Ustryalov and Kazembek rejecting the ideology of the Whites in favour of the Bolsheviks. This idealization lead to the development of the concept of a “Labour Monarchy”, and a system that combines Soviet democracy, Orthodox Integralism, Russian nationalism and the "revolutionary spirit". And as his Ideology grew and Changed, so did the influence of the Mladorossi within Transamur. Their influence grew and expanded, to a point where they could seize power following the Anti- Kolchak Coup. \n\n Now, Kazembek stands as the “Vozd” of the Rump State of Transamur. And though his influence may be currently small, Kazembek has plans to restore the Tsar, and soon reclaim all of Russia "
POLITICS_KYRIL_ROMANOV_MLAD_DESC: "Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, now Kirill I of Russia, is one of the most troublesome members of the House of Romanov. Strong-willed, ambitious, and determined to seize the throne, he has caused a headache to his first cousin, Nikolay II, several times. It is an open secret that during the February Revolution, Kirill actively worked against the Tsar and the rest of the House, even to the point where he ordered his men to raise the red flag above Petrograd - not because of any dedication to revolutionary ideals, but because of the hopes that he would become regent, or possibly even Tsar, after his cousin's abdication. \n\nAfter the execution of Nikolay and his family, Kirill claimed his rule over the scattered house of Romanov, a claim which was hotly contested by the rest of the family, who claimed that Kirill had no right to a restored Russian throne nor to lead the Russian royal family. By 1929, however, he was ultimately recognized, the untimely death of Grand Duke Nikolay certainly helped. While Kirill begrudgingly pays lip service to the Mladorossi, it truly doesn't matter to him who holds the keys to power; as long as he is in charge in some form. Even if Kirill is under practical House Arrest, and not but a powerless figurehead compared to Vozd Kazembek"
POLITICS_ALEXANDR_KOLCHAK_DESC: "Once a polar explorer and commander in the Imperial Russian Navy, who had also fought in both the Russo-Japanese War and the Weltkrieg, Kolchak is now the self-proclaimed "Supreme Ruler of Russia" in a puppet quasi-state in the Far East, unsuccessfully trying to throw off the shackles of Japanese imperialism. How did he come to such a life?\n\nWhen the civil war was raging in the vast expanses of Russia, Kolchak, in many ways suddenly for himself, was proclaimed the Supreme Ruler of Russia during the putsch in November 1918. Having first arrested the SRS and declared martial law, the imminent catastrophe was stopped by Boris Savinkov, who agreed with Kolchak on the adoption of the SR agrarian reform. The Whites were united and strong. The Siberian army soon merged with other white armies and by the end of 1919 the Bolsheviks surrendered. Having made a difficult choice in favor of Russia, Kolchak made an equally difficult choice, renouncing the supreme power and approving the Second Constituent Assembly in 1920.\n\nHowever, his relations with the newly created Russian Republic's government were quite hostile due to the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, which they had agreed to and signed, the Japanese Intervention in Transamur and Eastern Karelian Revolt. These relations only worsened in 1925 after Kolchak's unsuccessful coup d'etat against the government of Kerensky's "German lapdogs". The rogue admiral managed to escape from Russia and, ironically, found refuge in the pro-Japanese state of Transamur, the power in which belonged to the Kwantung army and the richest Merkulov family. Having enlisted the support of the ataman of the Transbaikal Cossacks Semenov and the East Siberian Oblastniks, as well as the support of Tokyo, Kolchak again found himself in the chair of the Supreme Ruler, but this time with a clear goal - to finish what he had started and overthrow the Petrograd regime."
POLITICS_SHUMYATSKY_DESC: "Boris Shumyatsky's parents were forced into exile in Siberia because they refused to leave their home. This incident has stuck with Shumyatsky, continually reminding him of the corruption within the Tsarist government based in Petrograd. A former Bolshevik, Shumyatsky was forced to leave Russia upon the conclusion of the Russian Civil War and has become an influential politician within Transamur. Despite his political views shifting towards the right, Shumyatsky continues to pursue the goal of turning Transamur into a welfare state. His past experience as a Bolshevik agitator has helped him gain a majority of the votes during the Presidential elections."
POLITICS_MERKULOV_DESC: "A former leader of the pro-Japanese Provisional Transamur Government, Merkulov and his brother are the richest people in Transamur. Now, as Kolchak no longer stands in his way and democracy has finally returned to Vladivostok, Merkulov, a son of a humble peasant, is eager to lead Transamur to prosperity. His vast and personal connections with the people have helped him gain a majority of the votes during the Presidential elections."
POLITICS_WOJ_DESC: "A leader of Czechoslovakian Legion and hero of the Russian Civil War, Wojciechowski has refused to accept the Brest-Litovsk treaty as legitimate. Outraged, he ceased all the contact with the government of the Russian Republic, and left for Transamur where he found many supporters. Formerly the right-hand man of admiral Kolchak, Sergei betrayed and killed his 'friend'. Less aggressive and ambitious than the rogue admiral, and a hardened veteran, Wojciechowski is now ready to advance West."
POLITICS_SEMYONOV_DESC: "An Ataman of the Baikal Cossacks, Semyonov and his boys had managed to establish a Transabaikal state, currently known as Transamur, in order to fight Bolsheviks who had been agitating in the Russian Far East. His newborn country was soon subjugated by Japan. When Kolchak's coup in 1925 had failed and the had rogue admiral had left Russia for Transamur, Semyonov was forced to resign and continue his career as military commander. However, the 'father-of-state' has managed to return, politically influential. Semyonov's only goal is to see Transamur prosper and, in order to do so, he is unwilling to wage uncertain wars."
POLITICS_YUI_DESC: "An old general, Mitsue is familiar with taking on command as he'd led the Japanese Expeditionary Corps during the Russian Civil War. A honourable war hero, he has been granted the ultimate gift from the emperor; to peacefully rule over the lands he'd conquered so many years ago. The old man is an isolationist and does not seek to wage any sort of war. With him assuming power as head of Transamur, the dream of a Greater Transamur has died."

### Parties ###
TRM_totalist_party: "Mladorossi"
TRM_totalist_party_long: "Mladorosskaya Partiya (Young Russia Party)\n§gThe history of the "Young Russian" movement is inexorably tied to its leader, the charismatic aristocrat Alexander Lvovich Kazem-Bek, born in 1902 to a wealthy noble family of Azeri and Iranian origin. The three ideological phases of the Mladorossi can be closely mapped to Kazem-Bek's own life and experience; unsurprisingly considering his role as orator and ideologist. As a student activist, Kazem-Bek helped form the "Union of Young Russia" in 1923. Uniting 29 organisations and 4,000 people, the Young Russians represented the monarchist youth wing. Prone to intellectualism and ideologically vague, its members jointly rejected reactionary Tsarism in favour of a "new and dynamic vision". As secretary, Kazem-Bek met with Professor Nikolai Ustryalov, once head of the press bureau under Admiral Kolchak. Ustryalov convinced the young aristocrat to throw his support behind the putsch against President Kerensky in 1924. Both fled to Transamur following the coup's failure, taking their respective supporters along with them. Ustryalov became disillusioned with the White movement, and began idolising the Bolsheviks as defenders of Russian sovereignty.\n\nThe formation of the "Union of Young Russians" in 1925 marked the second ideological phase of the Mladorossi. Kazem-Bek began formulating his thesis of the "Labor Monarchy" under Ustryalov's tutelage. The nascent ideology of the Mladorossi combined an absolute monarchy, Soviet democracy, Orthodox Integralism, Russian nationalism and the "revolutionary spirit". During this period of 1925-1933, most Mladorossi were united only by theatrical oath-swearing ceremonies and readership of journals such as "Vivacity!" and "Towards Young Russia". The third phase occurred shortly after Kazem-Bek's travels to the Syndicalist nations of Europe. Kazem-Bek was particularly inspired by the proto-Totalism of the French & Italian national syndicalists, as well as the British Mosleyites. On his return, Kazem-Bek formed the "Mladoross Party" in 1934 as its "Vozhd". His ideas on how to organise the Young Russian State have coalesced into a single-party corporatist model under a Worker-Monarch.\nWith a strict party structure and growing paramilitary wing, Kazem-Bek hopes to achieve control of Transamur, and then his beloved homeland, Russia.§!"

After the temporary downfall of Soviet power in Siberia, Centrosibir ceased to function in the summer of 1918. However, many delegates remained in Siberia and lay low, including the first chairman of the presidium, Boris Shumyatsky, who was granted amnesty after the end of the Civil War. Departing from orthodox Bolshevism, Centrosibir aims to separate Siberia from Russia and build a syndicalist workers' state, seeing in this the only salvation for the industrially undeveloped region."

Originally created during the Civil War to overthrow the Kolchak government as a reaction to the dire situation of peasant farms in Siberia. The situation was surprisingly brought under control, thanks to the efforts of Savinkov, who was able to convince the Supreme Leader of the need for concessions to the peasants. For the past 10 years, however, the Political Center had been preparing the ground for a new uprising, largely thanks to the subversive activities of the NRA guerrillas.§!"

Formed in 1931 by local politician and Kolchak loyalist, Anastasiy Vonsyatsky, the Natsionalisty have found support amongst Manchurian Russians and monarchist exiles. Young emigres still loyal to the ideals of a Russian Tsardom have flocked to this movement in awe of Vonsyatsky’s fiery speeches denouncing Bolshevism, Kerensky and Western Capitalism. All of which he accuses of degenerating the Russian people whilst declaring loyalty to Admiral Kolchak, the Russian Orthodox Church and a restored Tsardom. Espousing the homegrown ideology of “True Russian Nationalism”, the Natsionalisty have organised its members into a paramilitary force known as the, Black Vanguard, undoubtedly a reference to the Black Hundred.\n\n The Black Vanguard have provided security to Kolchak’s regime and have engaged in rounding up political dissidents as well as prominent members of the Jewish Vladivostok community accused of promoting ''dangerous foreign ideologies''. Admiral Kolchak has allowed for these actions to take place without officially endorsing the movements, perhaps to appease the Japanese authorities wary of an anti-foreign movement.§!"

### Events ###
tram.intro.t: "Transamur - Provisional Russian State in Vladivostok"
tram.intro.d: "Siberia and the Russian Far East had been a major area of conflict during the Russian Civil War, as the location of a short-lived democratic republic, the rising of the 'Czech Legion' and Japanese intervention. While forced to evacuate their forces due to German pressure (as well as intense resistance from local Cossacks), the Japanese remained eager to extend their influence and in 1922 pushed for the establishment of an independent state in the Transamur region. This motion gained the support of the Vladivostok business community, despite the fact that it left them vulnerable to forming an economic dependency on Japan. The majority of the business community however saw economic and diplomatic relations with the rising power in the East as a significant advantage, especially when compared to the alternative of being sucked further into the disorder besetting the rest of Russia. The new nation gained a prominent figurehead in the form of Admiral Kolchak, one of the most successful White Generals of the civil war and the one-time self-proclaimed 'Supreme Ruler of All Russia', who had been forced to flee Russia following his unsuccessful attempt to seize control in 1925.\n\nIn 1936, the Transamur Republic has become a corporate and militaristic state, highly tied economically to Japanese Empire. And yet Kolchak has ambitions of his own. Could he simply be playing a very dangerous game, using the Japanese protection to establish his own rule, first over Siberia, and then over Russia as a whole?"
tram.intro.a: "Interesting..."
tram.intro.b: "Tell me more about Transamur Politics"

tram.999.t: "The Oblastniki - Siberian Regionalists"
tram.999.d: "Siberian Regionalism is a political movement to form an autonomous Siberia. Firstly developed in the 19th century by Siberian students, it gained huge popularity during the Russian Civil War with the creation of the Provisional Government of Autonomous Siberia. However, the Provisional Siberian Government sacrificed own independence for the sake of consolidation of all possible forces to fight with Bolsheviks.\n\nDuring the rule of Kerensky, though Russia was stated as a federative republic, President has continuosly blocked all resolutions about giving wider autonomy to Siberia and it is still an undeveloped region.\n\nWhile the majority of the Siberia is under control of the Petrograd Regime, most of the Oblastniks, both leftist and rightist have support their former ally - Admiral Kolchak in the putsch as he promised wide autonomy to Siberia and he even invited a prominent Oblastnik - Pyotr Vologodsky to become a prime-minister.\n\nIn 1936 they are still waiting for Kolchak to finally unite Russia under his rule and proclaim Siberian Autonomy. Their resistance increases with their popularity and if it is high enough they can even attempt to overthrow Kolchak."

tram.998.t: "The Japanese Business Interests in Transamur"
tram.998.d: "The Japanese Empire has a huge influence on our country - they were the ones that intervened in the Far-East during the Russian Civil War and expanded their influence in the Transamur Region. In 1922 an independent nation was formed in Vladivostok, supported by local business community. However, everything changed, when in 1925 Kolchak tried to coup the Russian government and was forced to flee to Transamur, supported by Oblastniki and Transbaikal Cossacks.\n\nFinding himself in a partially-recognized state with only ally, Kolchak has nothing to do but establish even stronger economic ties with the Japanese Empire. While formally Transamur is independent, Japanese has a free military access to our territory and provide us with supplies. Our dependence on Japan varies proportionally with the popularity of the Japanese Delegation. If their influence becomes too high, they will try to establish full control over our country."

tram.997.t: "Vladivostok Business Community"
tram.997.d: "The business circles of Vladivostok-namely, the Merkulov Brothers, and other, smaller businessmen, were the basis of Transamur when this state was first proclaimed. Although in 1925 they did not become part of the Kolchak Council of Ministers, in fact, all foreign trade is based on them. Under their control, together with the Kwantung Army, is the port of Vladivostok. This situation allows the Merkulovs to get rich, the Japanese garrison to receive corrupt bribes, and Kolchak can only silently watch the rampant crime. With each visit of the Japanese delegation, the business community is becoming more and more focused on trade with Japan. And it seems that this state of affairs will remain unchanged until Kolchak decides to finally break all ties with the Japanese Empire."

tram.996.t: "DO-ROVS - Siberian Monarchists"
tram.996.d: "General Diterikhs is a convinced monarchist, whose ideas are sometimes even too radical. Disappointed in the decision of the constituent assembly to establish a Republic and not return the tsar to the throne, Diterikhs soon joined Kolchak's putsch in 1925 and ended up in Transamur with him.\n\nHere he founded the so-called 'Far Eastern Branch of the Russian All-Military Union' and settled in Nikolayevsk, where a camp of his 'Crusaders' has been created. In addition, Diterikhs also established military control over the Trans-Siberian Railway near the Rukhlovo station, where the railway connects Primorye with Transbaikalia and Yakutia.\n\nDiterikhs is still more or less loyal to the Admiral, as he hopes that the Supreme Ruler will restore the Monarchy as soon as he takes Moscow. Nobody knows why Diterikhs is so sure of this, but Kolchak should be careful, because if the DO-ROVS is not loyal to the Supreme Ruler, anything can be expected from them."

tram.995.t: "Ataman Semyenov and the Cossacks"
tram.995.d: "Ataman Semyenov is an extraordinary person. Fluent in Buryat and Mongolian, Semyenov has surrounded himself with loyal people and has his own interests in the Far Eastern region. The ataman of the Transbaikal Cossacks, Governor General of the Transbaikal Territory, the marching ataman of the Amur and Ussuri Cossacks, Semyenov is the main representative of the interests of the Cossacks in Transamur. Despite the fact that he supported Admiral Kolchak both during the civil war and during the coup, his real intentions are unknown. According to rumors, his Cossack troops are supplied with Japanese weapons.\n\nAt the moment, Semyenov is actually waging a war with the remnants of Bolshevism - the partisans of the NRA, and despite the fact that he supports the oblasts and Buryat autonomists, he is engaged in power struggle with them for power in Transbaikalia. It is not known how loyal the Cossacks are to Kolchak, but the Supreme Ruler knows one thing for sure - you can expect anything from them."

tram.994.t: "NRA and Political Centre"
tram.994.d: "When much of eastern Siberia came under the rule of the Cossacks and the loyalists of the Admiral-Dictator in 1925, there were those who did not end up here in exile. The Siberian Social Revolutionaries, who held power in the region and were legitimately elected, found themselves at a crossroads - either to flee their native regions to Russia, which was undergoing a severe political crisis at the dawn of Kerensky's presidency, or to stay here - and take up arms.\n\nIn order to resist the military dictatorship and the lawlessness of the Cossacks, the leader of the Siberian Social Revolutionaries, Evgeny Kolosov, established the Political Center, an association of the last real revolutionary democrats of the Far East. He was supported by Nikolai Kalashnikov, a prominent officer and Brigadier of the 53rd Siberian Rifle Regiment. The rebels soon became the People's Revolutionary Army - extremely small, but quite effective guerilla force, periodically arranging raids on the Trans-Siberian Railway. Soon the so-called New Bolsheviks - Boris Shumyatsky, the former leader of Siberian Soviet, Pyetr Nikiforov and even the Militant Godless - also joined the struggle and became associated with the NRA.\n\nHowever, the revolt failed. Trying to raise an uprising against the Siberian army, Kalashnikov deserted and hid in the Siberian taiga. Surprisingly, somehow the partisan movement in Transbaikalia was able to survive to this day. Perhaps the slave-like living conditions of the workers in Chita and Khabarovsk and the return of the landlord system in the agricultural areas contributed to this, but now the NRA is a patchwork of partisans, scattered all over Transbaikalia, agitating for a return to socialism and probably sponsored all along by the Kerensky regime. Leading an underground struggle and organizing sabotage, this movement must be destroyed."

tram.51.t: "Union of Musketeers of His Highness Prince Nikita Alexandrovich"
tram.51.d: "\"The Union of Musketeers\" was founded in 1924 in Harbin by Prince Vladimir Innokentyevich Gantimurov. Gantimurov, a native of Transbaikalia and belonging to the family of Tungus princes, served under General Molchanov in 1920 at the dawn of the Civil War. Gantimurov, the son of a border guard officer, was in Harbin at an early age. And in 1924 he was only 18 years old. His \"Union of Musketeers\", Vladimir Gantimurov, a romanticist and dreamer, decided to create after watching the film \"The Three Musketeers\". The first motto of the organization - \"One for All, and All for One\" - was also taken from the film about the Three Musketeers. Members of the Union of Musketeers came up with a distinctive uniform: black flared pants, worn loose, and black shirts \"Apache\" with laces on the collar and cuffs. The costume was complemented by black belts with tassels around the waist and a black cap. Subsequently, each branch was given a certain color and used on the uniforms the armbands of the corresponding color\n\nInitially, the organization did not pursue any political goals in its creation. The task was simple - to beat the children of Harbin Bolsheviks, who found themselves in Red Harbin after the defeat of the Reds in the Far East.  In search of ideological support, the leadership of the Union of Musketeers appealed to Grand Duke Nikita Romanov with a proposal to take patronage of the Union. After his positive response, on December 20, 1929, the name of the organization was changed and it was called henceforth \"Union of Musketeers of His Highness Prince Nikita Alexandrovich\". The Union also got political goals, the main of which were the overthrow of the Socialist Revolutionary regime in Russia and restoration of the monarchy. In 1931-1932, non-commissioned officer courses were opened by the Union together with the Russian All-Russian Military Union, and Gantimurov soon found himself in Nikolaevsk, where he joined the ranks of the DO-ROVS."
tram.51.a: "Interesting."

tram.52.t: "Royal Musketeers"
tram.52.d: "With the coronation of the new Tsar and the return of monarchy in Russia at last, albeit so far only in one part of it, the activities of the Musketeers' Union became much more active. Despite the fact that the patron of the organization, Nikita, was not particularly interested in the affairs of the Musketeers all this time, he saw before him well disciplined and organized fighters, who had long ago gone beyond the scope of children's games.\n\nThe leader of the Musketeers, Prince Gantimurov, appealed to the Sovereign Tsar to take into account the merits of the Musketeers and grant him a place in the Council of Ministers, as an adviser to His Majesty.\n\nAlthough Nikita Alekseyevich understood that it was better to surround himself with definitely loyal subjects, perhaps, in the situation in which he found himself, it was better to rely on the more experienced fighters of the ROVS who had actually gone through the war."
tram.52.a: "Promote our loyal musketeers to the government!"

tram.53.d: "In 1913, at the initiative of the worker of the Verkhneudinsk railroad depot G. I. Kamynin, an all-social cooperative society "Economia" was organized, which became one of the largest cooperatives in Siberia and Transbaikalia.\n\nAt the end of 1916 the cooperative opened a bakery, and later purchased a coarse-grain mill, a leather and chrome factory, a soap factory, a sawmill, a lumberyard in the village of Ganzurino, a fish cannery in Posolskoe, a dairy farm and a hog farm in Verkhneudinsk. In 1916 the cooperative opened its own sausage production in order to "improve the quality and price". Cooperative sausage was on sale in February 1917, which immediately reduced the price in private shops by 20 kopecks per pound, and soon private producers were also forced to improve their quality following the cooperative.\n\nHowever, already at the end of 1918 an underground NRA committee was established in Verkhneudinsk. And since then, it is believed that it was thanks to it that the NRA coordinated its subversive actions in the Transbaikalia. It cannot go on like this, and either this cooperative must be disbanded or it must be reorganized into a consumer society and placed under direct state control."

The Kolchak government tolerated him only because of his high patrons from Tokyo, because he was the main conduit of Japanese influence and thanks to him Japan supplied us with various things we needed, be it food or various kinds of weapons. Although these supplies were useful, they made Tranamur more and more dependent on Japan. But now the time has come for us to sever all our ties with the Japanese imperialists, who only want to profit from our country's resources, and to secure this \"treaty\" for severing relations, we will sign it with the blood of the ataman and his cronies.

But Kolchak is now gone. In his place is now Pepelyaev. And now he faces the question - what to do with the NRA? The generals say that the NRA is a red underdog and must be treated accordingly, and finally to finish off this last splinter of Red October. On the other hand, there are voices saying that the NRA consists of not only Bolsheviks but also Socialist-Revolutionaries and, taking into consideration Pepelyaev's own views, he could find a common language with that part of the NRA and smash the rest of the Bolsheviks. After listening to the pros and cons of both sides, Anatoly Pepelyaev decided that..."

And again, opinions are divided here, some say that we need to attract the monarchists to our side, and in order to do that, we need to promise them the restoration of the monarchy, because that is their main goal. Others say that the monarchists are the main breeding ground of reaction and, playing on Pepelyaev's feelings, argue that they are in favor of restoring the old serf landlord system, and therefore we should not cooperate with them, but suppress them by all the means we can. At the end of a long meeting, it was decided by Pepelyaev that..."

tram.62.d: "The Czechoslovak Legion is formally a subordinate military unit to Kolchak, but in fact it is more than independent, pursuing its own interests, the most important of which is the liberation of Bohemia and Slovakia from the oppression of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. But their independence is our greatest threat, for they were essentially the rulers of the Trans-Siberian Railroad, going back and forth and stopping wagons of soldiers and supplies. We cannot allow such a military force to dwell freely in our territories, for they can stab us in the back at any moment."

Many industrialists would then turn their backs on our government, and I don't think your new viceroys could manage their enterprises better than they could.\n\n- Victor, I understand everything, but now is an important moment, these same industrialists care only about their profits, like those Merkulovs, they care nothing about the people of Christ, they only care about their own income and money, it is more profitable for them to sell our homeland to Tokyo or Petrograd without a fight than to fight for our small and big homeland. Therefore, we must nationalize it, or our government will come to an end.\n\n- This argument gets us nowhere, so I propose a compromise, so as not to turn away all the big industrialists, then let's nationalize only the military industry? Understand, we need their help, so let's go with that option, okay?\n\nAfter a couple of minutes of reflection, Anatoly said:"

Victor, on the other hand, insisted that the complete socialization of land would harm small businesses. At the end of a long argument, he offered me a compromise, not to socialize all the land, but only part of it, to create and issue the so-called "Law on Land Quotas".

They are opposed by the Cadet elements, whose view is expressed by General Pepelyaev's brother Victor, who also recognizes the importance of the federal structure and local authorities, but believes that if the center has issued a law, the local authorities must obey it.\nAfter weighing the pros and cons, Pepelyaev decided that..."

tram.93.d: "It seems that the traitors in Transamur have finally realised the folly of their actions. Their miserable rump state is at war with Japan and they assuredly have no chance of victory in the face of Japanese military power. Representatives from Transamur have come to us begging us peacefully rejoin our nation, presumably in the hopes of avoiding conquest by Japan. Vladivostok is an important port, no doubt, but, are we ready to confront Tokyo yet?"
tram.93.a: "Welcome home Russians."
tram.93.b: "It's too risky..."

tram.94.t: "Transamur Reunifies with Russia"
tram.94.d: "It appears that the traitorous scum in Transamur have managed to temporarily escape their inevitable conquest by reunifying with Russia. Our pride demands retribution for their betrayal, but, is it wise to strike at Russia right now?"
tram.94.a: "To war!"
tram.94.b: "Transamur isn't worth it."

tram.95.t: "Russia Refuses Unification"
tram.95.d: "Despite our best efforts to join Russia, negotiations have failed, with the Russian representatives refusing to countenance our peaceful reunification. With vast Japanese forces arrayed against us, it seems that we are on our own."
tram.95.a: "Damn."

tram.96.t: "Disaster"
tram.96.d: "The so-called "Russian Government" have refused to return our lands. Moreover, they have declared war on us and eager to retake Vladivostok."
tram.96.a: "Damn!"

tram.97.t: "The Russian Republic Breaks Away!"
tram.97.d: "The Russian Republic has decided to leave our sphere of influence and cease all contact with us! Our elaborate military-industrial stranglehold over them and their fetid regime lies in ruins, and it appears that our carefully laid plains for increasing our influence in the Russian Far-East are in tatters."
tram.97.a: "Destroy them!"
tram.97.b: "We can do nothing, for now."

tram.98.t: "Coup in Transamur"
tram.98.d: "News about anti-Kolchak coup in Transamur has recently reached us. It appears that Alexander Kolchak, our de-facto puppet leader of the Vladivostok regime, has been removed from power, and [TRM.GetLeader] has become the new dictator. Perhaps we should try to counter-coup him before he starts a geopolitical crisis?"
tram.98.a: "Greet the new government."
tram.98.b: "We should attempt to oust the new government."

tram.100.t: "Admiral Kolchak Murdered in Transamur"
tram.100.d: "News about anti-Kolchak coup in Transamur has recently reached us. It appears that rebels have successfully killed Alexander Kolchak, our close ally, and General Diterikhs has become the new dictator. Although he is less brave and ambitious than his former political rival, Diterikhs still has great expansionist vision for Transamur. Perhaps we should try to coup him before he starts a geopolitical crisis?"
tram.100.a: "Greet the new government."

tram.102.t: "Admiral Kolchak Murdered in Transamur"
tram.102.d: "The leader of the 1925 coup, rogue admiral Alexander Kolchak was recently killed by his own soldiers during a military coup in his beloved Transamur state. A man of great ambitions, he had contested our rights to rule the Russian Republic until his last breath. With his death, our society become a bit more pacified."
tram.102.a: "So, the bastard is gone. Excellent!"

tram.103.t: "Transamurian Currency in Harbin"
tram.103.d: "Harbin is an important city, placed in the middle of Fengtian's territory, and connects two parts of the Chinese Eastern Railway which our republic sold to the Fengtian government in 1927. But even now lots of the Russians live there and play a significant role in the railway. Since many of them have bonds with us, they prefer to use the more or less stable Transamurian Ruble instead of the fluctuating Fengtian Tael, though its unclear if the transactions with our currency are legal or not. Our Economic Minister has proposed that we should make an agreement with Fengtian, which will allow the usage of the Transamurian Ruble in Harbin, but will permit additional taxation by the Fengtian Government."
tram.103.a: "Let's propose it!"
tram.103.b: "The current situation is acceptable."

tram.104.t: "Siberian Rouble in Harbin"
tram.104.d: "Transamur has proposed that we allow transactions between our own currency and the Siberian Rouble in Harbin, which has the largest Russian population in the whole of the Northeast. The government in Vladivostok says that we will be able to tax these transactions, moreover such an agreement could have a positive influence the industrial development of the city as well as the region, where the local Russian business started to make various investments. But, some members of our government mention that the free use of the Siberian Ruble can lead to the increase of Harbin's autonomy."
tram.104.a: "An agreement will help our economy."
tram.104.b: "We don't need this deal."

tram.105.t: "Fengtian Accepts"
tram.105.d: "The Fengtian Government has agreed to allow the usage of our currency in Harbin. We hope that it will strengthen the economic bonds between our countries."
tram.105.a: "Excellent."

tram.108.t: "Setbacks Against Transamur"
tram.108.d: "It seems that we have underestimated our enemies in Vladivostok. Their forces are rolling over Eastern Siberia defeating our troops and capturing the cities. Perhaps it would be wise to consider ceding the lands that they have claimed in exchange for peace between us?"
tram.108.a: "They're just wastelands anyway..."
tram.108.b: "No! It's just a temporary setback."

tram.109.t: "Russia Proposes Peace"
tram.109.d: "Our mighty military forces are rolling over Eastern Siberia, liberating cities and people from oppression. These cowards who dare to call themselves the Russian government appear to be willing to cede the lands we previously demanded from them. Should we sign a peace treaty or take advantage of Russian military weakness by continuing the war?"
tram.109.a: "A reasonable deal."

tram.110.d: "with the regime in Transamur appearing to reciprocate our overtures for peace, it seems that the conflict is now over.

tram.118.d: "Today, a major anti-Japanese rally was held in Vladivostok. Crowds of angry protesters have demanded that we end our partnership with Japan and expel their powerful delegation from our country. Special agents have already identified the agitators responsible for this demonstration. Though we should be attempting to crush these subversive elements, we could instead use them to reduce Japanese influence in Transamur."
tram.118.a: "We can't afford these propagandists."
tram.118.b: "They shall be useful stooges against Japanese dominance."

tram.119.t: "Japan Demands Transamur Control"
tram.119.d: "With Japanese influence growing every day, we can barely control the country. Today, the Imperial Delegation from Tokyo demanded that the leadership of Transamur resign and allow them to rule the Transamur, a harsh insult indeed. Though doing so would incur the wrath of the powerful Japanese military, we currently still have the opportunity to expel the Delegation and declare our total independence from Japan. The proud people of Transamur are not mere serfs and if we are going to die, we shall die defending our country from this naked imperialism!"

Now, with the political atmosphere somewhat cooler, the opportunity has finally come for Wojciechowski to choose a deputy to help rule his military cabinet. There are three candidates for this post: the current head of government General Semyenov; young and ambitious general Pepelyaev and conservative Admiral Stark. Though fresh blood may gives us a new opportunities, serious ideological differences exist between Wojciechowski and the more liberal Pepelyaev and Stark will potentially lead to tensions later."

tram.121.d: "After their victory in the Second Russian Civil war, the Reds have begun to terrorise their internal enemies. Many former White forces and their supporters have managed to flee from mainland Russia to join our cause against the Bolsheviks taking advantage of a period of instability and anarchy in Siberia to flee east. Along with soldiers, several well-educated officers have arrived offering their services. No matter their prior political affiliations, together we must strike at the Red Hydra!"
tram.121.a: "Welcome home, brothers!"

tram.122.t: "More Exiles Arrive in Transamur"
tram.122.d: "A long period of political instability in mainland Russia has caused anarchy to erupt in distant parts of Siberia. With the [RUS.Capital.GetName] regime otherwise occupied containing instability in the West, it is quite difficult for them to exert real power over this region. People are losing hope in their leaders and fleeing to our country. More and more refugees and exiles are joining our cause."
tram.122.a: "Welcome home, brothers!"

tram.123.t: "Send Agitators into Siberia"
tram.123.d: "With the death of Kerensky the political situation in Russia proper is more chaotic than it has been even in recent years. Some of our ministers believe that the opportunity now exists for us to strike again. We should start with sending agents to push our agenda all across the Eastern Siberia. If the people hear us it is inevitable that they will join with us to bring down the corrupt regime in the West."

tram.124.goodagit: "Recent reports have reached us making clear that our plan to send agitators into Siberia to spread our ideas was even more effective than we had predicted before. A number of people, many of them armed and military trained, left their homes for our host. We now have enough additional manpower for a good division."

Once Kolchak's ally, the monarch guaranteed his safety in 1925 until the British Revolution. His son, [CAN_king_first_name] has now ascended to the throne in Canada. Although, neither Kolchak or [CAN_king_first_name] know each other personally, this resetting of relations could be the start of a long period of partnership between our countries. We should send an envoy to negotiate for support."
tram.125.a: "Strong allies are always good."

tram.126.t: "Envoy from Transamur"
tram.126.d: "Today an envoy from the petty military junta of Transamur has come to visit His Majesty, [CAN_king_full_name]. In his speech, the envoy informed us about King George V's previous support of Kolchak's 1925 unsuccessful coup in Petrograd and assured us that this time the rogue admiral will triumph - however, he once again requests support from the Entente. We owe Kolchak nothing, but maybe he's not that useless? How should we answer?"
tram.126.a: "Assure him that he'll get everything he need."
tram.126.b: "Limited support will be enough."

tram.127.fullsupport: "Our envoy has returned with magnificent news: [CAN_king_full_name] has expressed a deep respect for our cause. The King has promised that we can rely on him for some degree of military support. It seems that the Entente is now an effective partner for our regime."
tram.127.partialsupport: "Our envoy has returned with good news: [CAN_king_full_name] has expressed a respect for our cause. However, though the King has promised to partially support us, he has refused to give us complete backing. While the outcome is not as great as we had previously hoped, some support from the Entente is most welcome."
tram.127.nosupport: "Our envoy has returned with unfortunate news: [CAN_king_full_name] has expressed little interest in our cause, to put it mildly. The King said bluntly that we are nothing but a clique of buffoons desperately trying to preserve our rule. He promised absolutely nothing from the Entente and our relationships has definitely worsened."

tram.127.c: "What a rude person..."

tram.128.t: "Vladivostok Treaty"
tram.128.d: "The war between Japan and Transamur seems to lose any reason it had before. Japanese troops, taking casualties form brave Russian defenders, were unable to conquer Vladivostok for so long time the entire perspective of taming Transamur may now cost more than Transamur can possibly give in return.\n\n[JAP.GetLeader] and [TRM.GetLeader] meets today in Vladivostok to sign a white peace treaty and end all hostilities between these two countries. It seems that Japan has lost its only tool to press Russia. People of Transamur are celebrating this outstanding victory."

tram.128.jap: "Curse you, traitors."

tram.129.t: "Moving the Capital to Irkutsk"
tram.129.d: "We now control Irkutsk which provides us with an industrial base to build up our country. In order to continue with our aspirations of a united Russia we must relocate the provisional capital to Irkutsk. This may alarm the Japanese as it would give them an indication of our true goal but it would also lower their influence"
tram.129.a: "It is worth the risk."

tram.130.t: "Moving the Capital to [570.GetName]"
tram.130.d: "As our might grows stronger every day we become more and more autonomous from Japan and their imperial ambitions. Moving the provisional capital to [653.GetName] will show them that we are their lapdogs no more."
tram.130.a: "One step closer towards freedom."

tram.131.t: "Moving the Capital to Moscow"
tram.131.d: "Moscow hasn't been the capital of a united Russian State since 1712 when Peter The Great made what is now Petrograd the capital. Since the illegitimate Petrograd Regime used the city we should perhaps consider using Moscow as our new capital, not only to distance ourselves from the petrograd regime but as a callback to the foundation of Russia. "

tram.132.t: "Moving the Capital to Petrograd"

tram.147.t: "The Oblastniki Issue"
tram.147.d: "The Oblastniki are demanding more and more from our government. At first, they demanded their own local committees, than local Dumas, now they are asking for local governors. Their influence - and, therefore, resistance is growing from day to day. But we give them what the Russian Republic never did - the widest autonomy. There are many of Oblastniki in the Council of Ministers, lobbying the separatist influences. Perhaps, we should finally start to limit this pathetic movement?"

tram.1481.d.kolchaksurvivedthecoup: "Some of the ministers in the government allowed the coup to happen. Kolchak strongly believes that this situation has only happened because of his promises and insufficient rigidity.

tram.149.t: "Our Relations With the Japanese"
tram.149.d: "From the foundation of our state, Japan was our closest ally. While Kolchak considers current state of relations with Japanese a temporary and necessary measure to be strong, he understands that this position may be considered vulnerable and make his rule illegitimate in the eyes of common Russians. Nevertheless, we need this ties for now and it seems that we will have to cope with the Japanese influence until the Siberian Army enters Moscow."

tram.1491.d: "From the foundation of our state, Japan was our closest ally. However, things have changed. The influence of the Japan is becoming more and more overwhelming which make us vulnerable. We must make the right choice once and for all: either we join the Japanese officially or completely cut ties with them."

tram.155.d: "The small room was illuminated by a barely bright light, which was even dimmer because of the large crowd inside. In the middle of the church-school of Our Lady of Sorrows in memory of Russian soldiers, in fact the only cathedral of the Vladivostok diocese, Prince Nikita Alexandrovich sat on his knees before Archbishop Meletius of Harbin and Manchuria. Standing far away was Zemsky Voivode Diterikhs - inexorably aging, but proud.\n\n\"O God crowned, and God-given, and God-praised, Most Pious, Most Autocratic, Great Sovereign Emperor of All Russia! Receive the scepter and the orb, which is the visible image of the autocracy given to You by the Most High for Your people, for their government and for the adjustment of all their desirable happiness,\" said Meletius and handed to Nikita in his right hand a scepter and in his left an orb.\n\nFrom that moment Nikita Aleksandrovich clearly understood that he was not just a prince. The sacredness of the crowning ceremony permeated him, and it seemed that God was really giving him power - noble power.\n\nAccepting the crown from the bishop, the emperor laid it on himself. It was not a real crown, kept in the Kremlin, but it was a powerful symbol of royal power.\n\nMeletius continued with the ceremony. \"Pious most autocratic Great Sovereign Emperor of All Russia! This visible and material adornment of Thy Head is the clear image, as Thou art the Head of the All-Russian people, crowned invisibly by the King of Glory, Christ, by His blessed blessing, confirming to Thee the sovereign and supreme power over His people\".\n\nFrom this moment on Nikita Alexandrovich became emperor. Not yet All-Russian, as Meletius said, but only Siberian. But the liberation of all Russia is near, and it is Nikita who must become the main symbol of this liberation."

This decision, however, opens new opportunities for us to finally unite with an unrecognized state in the Far-East. On the other hand, if we don't, some monarchist generals can join their government. Chkheidze has delivered a large speech in the Senate, where he theoretically justified that the restoration of Romanov Monarchy is necessary to achieve popular support of our government. He claims that with the Tsar back, our legitimacy can be secured and a long tradition of monarchy will continue.\n\nThe Senate, however, was divided on this issue. The ones stated that we should not move away from the Orthodox Eurasianist doctrine, but the others believed in Chkheidze's theses. With the prospect of peaceful union with the Far East on the line, his proposal is likely to be passed by the majority of the Senate. However, they can also listen to the opinion of Trubetzkoy and other founding fathers, who are unlikely to support Chkheidze."

tram.175.d: "The leaders and organisators of the NSP, PLSR and RKP parties were the ones that brought our country to the Civil War in 1918 and the ones that continued to destabilize it in 1920s and 1930s. We should now decide - either we should go on with restrictions and bans or decide their fate once and for all - sentence them for treason."

tram.176.t: "The Trial of the ROVS"
tram.176.d: "The ROVS, organisation of White Generals, created by Lavr Kornilov and his closest allies was the force that prevented Russia from full democratization. Consisting of far-right adepts, monarchists and supporters of strong dictatorial power. If we allow them to operate, they will continue to promote rightist rhetoric, however, we will have a strong and sufficient army organisation."
tram.176.a: "Ban ROVS"
tram.176.b: "Allow them to operate - they can be useful."

tram.177.t: "The Trial of the PSR"
tram.177.d: "The Socialist-Revolutionaries was once the most popular party in Russia, that promoted many social reforms in our country. However, since Kerensky has proven to be a rather bad leader, many of the PSR members have turned away from him. On the other hand, most of them support even more radical policies that Kerensky was too afraid to implement. What shall we do?"

tram.1005.a: "Too bad."

tram.200.t: "The Supreme Ruler of Russia"
tram.200.d: "Even during the Civil War, when hordes of bloodthirsty Bolsheviks were trying to throw Russia into chaos, Admiral Kolchak made an important and responsible decision - to become the Supreme Ruler of Russia before the convocation of the Constituent Assembly to unite the forces of the Whites in the fight against the Reds.\n\nThe barely maintained peace between the SRs, Kadets, and Military Generals lasted until the end of the war, and in 1920, after driving out the Bolsheviks, Kolchak, then-Prime Minister Sazonov, and Kerensky were forced to sign the Minsk Treaty. After some time, the second Constituent Assembly was convened, and Kolchak resigned from his position as the Supreme Ruler of Russia.\n\nBut the next 5 years changed everything. First, the ongoing Japanese occupation of Transamur, in which local businesses seized power, effectively turning Vladivostok into a Japanese colony. Secondly, the German \"occupation\" of Russian industry, approved by Kerensky in the name of economic prosperity. Third, the rampant left-wing forces, famine in the Volga region, indulgences for the peasants, alienation of the property of the rich.\n\nAll this led to the event known as the Kolchak Putsch of 1925. And now the admiral has once again taken on the furrows of the Supreme Ruler, leading the Russian State in exile, waiting for the chance to return to Moscow and finally restore order in Russia."
tram.200.a: "And now we are here..."

tram.201.t: "The NRA Partisan Warfare"
tram.201.d: "From the very moment when the Whites seized power in Siberia and the Far East, the Far Eastern People's Revolutionary Army (NRA), funded by the Bolsheviks, operated in the region. With the loss of the Bolsheviks, the NRA continued its activities, but completely went underground, periodically arranging political assassinations and attempts on high-ranking officials. 15 years later, the NRA is still active... and either the lack of DO-ROVS agents, or the incompetence of the Transbaikal Cossacks, or the lack of infrastructure, prevents the exposure and destruction of this terrorist group.\n\nIn addition, the NRA also distributes outright Bolshevik propaganda, which tries to radicalize the workers of the large industrial cities of the Far East: Chita, Khabarovsk, etc. We must identify and destroy all the underground branches of the NRA, get their leadership and execute them before they plunge the Far East into the chaos of Bolshevism."
tram.201.a: "Narodism must eventually die out."

tram.202.t: "Merkulov Brothers"
tram.202.d: "Business circles in Vladivostok are the origins of such a state as Transamur. It was they, sponsored by the Japanese government, who declared the Transamur Protectorate. Everything changed in 1925, when the territory of Transamur radically increased, and in Vladivostok, in addition to them and the Japanese, the Siberian Army of Kolchak, the DO-ROVS, the Cossacks and the Siberian Regionalists appeared. Vladivostok, thus being the capital of Transamur, became a chessboard for all political groups of Transamur. And maybe Kolchak thinks that he is in charge here, but this is a mistake.\n\nAt the head of Vladivostok is the Japanese garrison of the Kwantung army, which guards the port of Vladivostok, and without its permission, no goods enter Vladivostok. But permission is very easy to get, especially if you belong to the Merkulov family - the richest entrepreneurs in the Far East. With a pocket Japanese garrison, the Merkulov brothers are trying not only to subdue the entire Vladivostok trade, but also politics with Spiridon Merkulov's National-Democratic Union being one of the largest allowed political parties in the Far-East."
tram.202.a: "Watch them closely..."

tram.205.t: "Help With Fighting NRA?"
tram.205.d: "In war, all means are good, and to finally finish off the SR infection in the Far East, we can turn to one of the political groups loyal to us. There are only two options: the Semyenov Cossacks, who will easily deal with the partisans in their native lands, or the Diterikhs DO-ROVS-organized and disciplined military, who almost as much hate the Bolsheviks as we do."
tram.205.a: "We will need Semyenov's help"
tram.205.b: "We will need Diterikhs's help"
tram.205.c: "We will cope alone."

tram.206.t: "Crusade Against Narodniks!"
tram.206.d: "General Diterikhs declared a crusade against Socialism. Armed not only with rifles and ammunition, but also with faith in our Savior Jesus Christ, the vigilantes of the Holy Cross are ready to destroy the cursed heresy of Socialism.\n\nDestroying any agitation and propaganda of the partisans of the People's Revolutionary Army, the Squads of the Holy Cross bring light to the uneducated masses of the Far East. Long live the new Inquisition! Long live General Diterikhs! Long live Admiral Kolchak!"
tram.206.a: "It seems NRA is doomed."

tram.207.t: "Cossacks, Armed With Japanese Rifles!"
tram.207.d: "The participation of the Transbaikal Cossacks in the suppression of the partisan war of the People's Revolutionary army brought not only good, but also suspicious rumors. Local residents say that the Cossacks who came to liberate them from the oppression of Socialism were armed with Japanese rifles, and some columns consisted of Fentian and Japanese officers. Of course, it is quite strange that the Cossacks are quietly walking around in the presence of foreign armed forces,but there is such a question. How can the locals even know what Japanese rifles look like?"
tram.207.a: "At least they fight NRA"

tram.208.t: "Siberian Regional Council"
tram.208.d: "For too long, we have promised to give the oblasts autonomy without doing anything. Not surprisingly, over the years, their discontent grew more and more. It's time to stop making promises and do something about it. We will form the Siberian Regional Council, or Sibsovet, which will be the authorized body of the Supreme Ruler in the lands with civil administration. This body will have supreme executive and legislative power in these regions, which, of course, will be limited only to the Supreme Ruler and the Council of Ministers."
tram.208.a: "Triumph of Siberian Regionalism!"

tram.210.t: "Zemsky Sobor"
tram.210.d: "In the city of Vladivostok, the Great Zemsky Sobor is held, under the leadership of Voivode Mikhail Diterikhs. In the conditions of the fact that our motherland is enslaved by socialist enemies, we are the last stronghold of the Russian people, who keep in their hearts a fervent love for the Dying Motherland!\n\nThe Zemsky Sobor makes the following decision:\n'Letter of the Amur Zemsky Sobor to the Russian People of the Great Russian Land': We call for national unity around the Vladivostok government, so that God will grant a single Sovereign Leader to the great-power Russian Land. We hand over the supreme power to the Romanov dynasty, so be it!\n\nUntil the arrival of the Russian Tsar in Vladivostok and his coronation as the current tsar of All-Siberia and the Tsar of All-Russia in exile, Mikhail Diterikhs, who was previously elected Voivode of the Zemsky Krai and the Zemsky Rat, will serve as regent. For this, the Sobor is concluded."
tram.210.a: "The Tsar Will Return!"

tram.211.t: "Merkulovs In Power"
tram.211.d: "The richest family in Transamur has finally seized power in the country, even through democratic elections. With Spiridon Merkulov as president and Nikolay Merkulov as prime-minister, both of them are looking with greed at restoring the ties with Japan and expanding their business interest. The Merkulovs are looking forward to enriching themselves rather than claiming to be the legitimate Transamur Government. But, perhaps, if they control all of Russia, they will be even more richer and powerful."

tram.212.t: "Supreme Ruler's Announcement"
tram.212.d: "Today, the Supreme Ruler of Russia, Aleksander Kolchak, announced to the Council of Ministers that in the near future he plans to dissolve the Council of Supreme Ruler and form a new government. Not to say that the news was received by the ministers with enthusiasm, as many of them suspected something was wrong. The main and most reasonable suspicions arose, of course, from Prime Minister Vologodsky, despite his long acquaintance and the position of prime minister in the very first Kolchak government during the civil war.\n\nKolchak does not have many options for forming a new government, but one of the key decisions is to remove regional officials from the government and replace them with either more loyal military or Cossacks, or, conversely, to form a government of 'people's trust'."
tram.212.a: "We'll see"

tram.213.t: "Tensions in Vladivostok"
tram.213.d: "Kolchak's statement, despite its seemingly routine in the political sphere, seems to have led to a crisis among ministers, which affected the overall stability of the country. The news about the formation of a new government has raised the ears of the whole of Vladivostok, and people are wondering who will become the new prime minister under the Supreme Ruler. In addition, citizens are afraid of Japan's interference in the decision of Kolchak. Against the background of small popular unrest and a sharp aggravation of distrust of the Supreme Ruler, slogans of free and fair elections are again heard on the streets."
tram.213.a: "Something is happening"

tram.215.t: "A Delegation From [FROM.GetNameDefCap]"
tram.215.d: "The government of [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has sent us a foreign delegation, asking for an official recognition of our state as legitimate Russian government. The regime of the self-proclaimed Supreme Ruler of Russia may seem to us ridiculous, but if we are feeling free to oppose the Russian Government in Petrograd and Moscow, we can formally recognize [FROM.GetAdjective] independence."
tram.215.a: "We should not recognize this Japanese colony..."
tram.215.b: "They will have our recogniton"

tram.218.d: "Our motherland, once again broken, bloodied and weak, and all through the fault of geeks like Kerensky, Milyukov and others, who sold our country to the Germans for the damned Reichsmark. But apart from them, the country is rotten through and through with socialist ideas that literally poison the air, and the army under the leadership of the incompetent Kornilov was simply ruined. It's time to restore order with a firm hand. May a fair and just trial take place!"
tram.218.a: "All rise for the Honorable Chief Justice"

tram.219.t: "Trial of the Bolsheviks"
tram.219.d: "Several dozen people who have been identified by us directly as members or former members of a group of Bolsheviks, also known as Reds, or Communists, are being tried in the case of a coup d'etat and an attempted coup d'etat. Some of them were not caught or managed to leave the border while the Siberian Army stormed Moscow, but some of the defendants could not escape a fair trial. So, the defendants in the case, Bukharin N. I., Zhukov G. K., Spiridonova M. A., Rykov A. I., and others, are accused of treason to the Motherland, as well as the creation of several party socialist organizations aimed at establishing the power of workers and peasants, as stated. Nevertheless, in fact, these groups of individuals planned to establish their own sole power, destroy and decompose the army, question and ostracize the patriots of the Motherland who still have honor, dignity and conscience. The court ruled. The guilt of the above-mentioned citizens has been proven, the decision of the court in cases of high treason is not subject to appeal or review. Taking into account the circumstances in the form of plans to overthrow specifically the regime of A. F. Kerensky, who was also declared a criminal posthumously, the court softens the decision and appoints a sentence of life imprisonment to the accused."
tram.219.a: "Fair enough."

tram.220.t: "Trial of the Socialists-Revolutionaries & Mensheviks"
tram.220.d: "The defendants in the case of anti-Russian actions aimed at destroying the state foundations have arrested several high-ranking persons who are somehow connected with A. F. Kerensky and the so-called Party of Socialist Revolutionaries, including V. M. Chernov, N. D. Avksentiev, and others. In addition, the leaders of the RSDLP party, or the so-called Mensheviks, who also took part in the Petrograd regime in one way or another, are also being investigated. Taking into account the past achievements of these politicians, including participation in the suppression of the Bolshevik putsch during the civil war, as well as alienation from the administration of the country by A. F. Kerensky, the court made the following decision. Given the mitigating circumstances, these persons are..."

tram.221.d: "Regardless of the court's decision in the case of the Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, the fate of their parties remains open. On the one hand, they should be banned immediately, but it should be taken into account that the RSDLP represents the interests of the working class, and the AKP is one of the largest parties in the country, and their complete ban implies an unstable situation in the country. In addition, the interests of these parties are lobbied by Siberian regional officials, many of whom were directly or are members of these parties. A compromise solution would be to ban these parties, but instead create a pro-government party of workers and peasants, which will definitely not encroach on state power."
tram.221.a: "Ban these two remnants of the past..."

tram.222.d: "Despite the fact that the liberal party was not distinguished by rabid Russophobia, like the previous ones, its leader, Pavel Milyukov, was prime minister under Kerensky all the years of his reign, that is, in fact, he was the main person who allowed the rampant Germans and corruption in the country, so he should have been arrested and tried as a criminal, despite all his patriotism and whatever he said. The KDP party itself should pass into the hands of... more loyal people, like Viktor Pepelyaev, the leader of the Party of Constitutional Democrats of the Far East. However, maybe we should avoid past mistakes and ban all this rotten movement of liberals?"

A former terrorist and a member of the Socialist - Revolutionary Party created his own party, but we must pay tribute to him-he also wanted to overthrow Kerensky as much as Kolchak. His party was opposed to the Germans and against Kerensky, and sought to revive the Russian people. However, he is still a socialist and has great ambitions, and it is at least risky to leave him free."

tram.224.t: "Fate of Lavr Kornilov"
tram.224.d: "Russian generals are people with whom we fought side by side in the civil war, but who betrayed Russia for the sake of German subsidies. General Kornilov is a traitor who ruined the country and the army. Generals Wrangel and Denikin are his accomplices. Unfortunately, the last two managed to escape from the country, but General Kornilov remained, and now he is a defendant at a military tribunal. He is already an old man, so they will not treat him so harshly, and therefore the court sentences him to the highest penalty - execution by firing squad. With the death of General Kornilov, a shameful era in the history of the army will end."
tram.224.a: "An end he deserved."

tram.225.t: "Fate of the Unions"
tram.225.d: "The Petrograd regime under the leadership of the socialist Kerensky was undoubtedly full of various kinds of trade unions, allegedly protecting the rights of workers. In fact, they were hotbeds of socialism and other anti-Russian heresy. The most important of them was the VTSPS under the leadership of the Menshevik Lozovsky, a traitor to the Motherland. We can completely ban the trade union movement in Russia, so that we no longer face strikes and protests. Another option is to put your people in the highest positions in these trade unions, as well as to de-socialize them so that they meet the interests of the country. Or we can leave everything as it is in the hope that in this way we will earn the trust of the working class."

In addition, the State Duma will be established, which has legislative functions, but any bill must be approved by the Supreme Ruler of Russia before it is adopted. In addition, the procedure for terminating the powers of the Supreme Ruler of Russia is also established - in the event of a serious illness, death or resignation, the head of the Council of Ministers will take his position until a special meeting is convened, at which a new Supreme Ruler will be elected."

tram.406.a: "Great"

tram.407.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
tram.407.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused our offer. Without access to Altai, we will stuck near Lake Baikal and our offensive will fail."

tram.407.b: "We are not really ready to fight them now."

tram.408.t: "The Question of the KVZhD"
tram.408.d: "The Chinese Eastern Railway, now under Mantetsu influence, should belong to us, which basically means occupying most of the Northern Manchuria. This will definetely be against Japanese interests in the region, but perhaps we will be able to do this without much interference from Tokyo."

tram.408.b: "This is just between us and the Fengtian"

tram.409.t: "Transamur Interests in Northern Manchuria"
tram.409.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has visited Tokyo today in order to solve the Chinese Eastern Railway issue. While once part of the Trans-Siberian railway, it connected Vladivostok to the rest of the Empire, but now Transamur is in a dire need of control over this railway to supply their troops in preparation of the offensive against [RUS.GetName]. While their access to the railway is just half of the deal, they want a complete control over Northern Manchuria, which we cannot allow without any significant benefits for us."
tram.409.a: "They can have it, but we demand control over their government"

tram.410.t: "Japan Demands Control Over Our Government"
tram.410.d: "The Japanese government has agreed to give us Northern Manchuria, but they demand control over our government, which will make us their colony, most likely. This means that we won't be able to have our independent foreign policy."
tram.410.a: "We can't allow this to happen"
tram.410.b: "It seems we don't have a choice."

tram.411.t: "Japan Demands Significant Concessions"
tram.411.d: "The Japanese government has agreed to give us Northern Manchuria, but with significant concession. First off, they will get full access to the Port of Vladivostok, Kamchatka and Okhotsk, literally closing our access to the Pacific Ocean."
tram.411.a: "This is too risky"
tram.411.b: "KVZhD is much important now."

tram.412.t: "Japan Agrees With Reservations"
tram.412.d: "The Japanese government has agreed to give us Northern Manchuria, but the Mantetsu will still be in control of the railway, which means that their influence will spread widely in our country."

tram.412.a: "This does not suit us really"

tram.413.t: "Japan Allows Military Access"

tram.10002.d: "With our rule in the Old Russian Far East being secured day by day, we have been greeted by the prospect of changing the city names from the old Kolchak regime to that of the honorable Chysanthemum Throne. While Japan-izing the Far East may take time, this change will be inevitable. Yet, there are still some in our lands who cherish the tyranny of old from the Russians, and it will undoubtedly anger those who still see themselves as heirs of the true Russia. Shall we make this brash move to further incorporate this land to Tokyo?"
tram.10002.a: "An excellent plan, damn the Russians."
tram.10002.b: "We mustn't act too brashly."

trmnra.1.t: "Blagoveshchensk Uprising"
trmnra.1.d: "The city of Blagoveshchensk is the largest transportation hub and industrial center of the Amur Province. Since yesterday, workers in Blagoveshchensk have been demanding higher wages and shorter working hours. Strikes organized jointly by the People's Revolutionary Army and the Central Siberian Army grew into open disturbances. Urgent measures must be taken to suppress this vicious uprising!"

trmnra.2.d: "It became known that General Boguslavsky took the side of the rebels and the division under his command joined the rebels. Moreover, the Blagoveshchensk garrison laid down its arms.\n\nThe Amur Cossacks stationed on the other side of the Zeya River, as well as the remaining loyal units, were cut off from Blagoveshchensk by the blown-up bridges on the Amur and Zeya. "
trmnra.2.a: "Catastrophic!"

trmnra.3.t: "Proclamation of the Far-Eastern People's Republic"
trmnra.3.d: "With the escalation of the conflict in Blagoveshchensk, workers in other major cities - Chita, Khabarovsk, and Vladivostok - also turned against our government. Despite the fact that martial law was declared throughout the Far Eastern Republic, this did not prevent the NRA from arming the self-defense units. The rebel leader, General Kalashnikov, made a statement to overthrow the dictatorship throughout the Far East. Although this statement was untrue, it motivated many peasants to join the uprising. Now power in the major cities has indeed passed to the NRA, but there are still the last pockets of resistance."
trmnra.3.a: "The end of dictatorship!"

trmnra.4.t: "Transbaikal Cossacks Declare Independence!"
trmnra.4.d: "We have definetely underestimated the NRA. Not only is it an armed militia, but they are also professional mercenaries. After Khabarovsk and Chita had fallen under the Red Banner, socialists tried to establish control over Vladivostok. We would have won easily, but the majority of the population seem to be dissatisfied with Kolchak's rule and they are stupid enough to join the bloody socialists. The streets of Vladivostok are now covered in blood."

trmnra.4.b: "We should save Russia from socialist bandits!"

trmnra.6.t: "Admiral Kolchak Murdered"

We can only imagine what happened to his body, but there is only one fact we know for sure - the NRA has declared the Far-Eastern Socialist Republic."

trmnra.40.d: "The NRA has definitely underestimated us. After workers rose up in Khabarovsk, we shot their leaders. The remaining militia and mercenaries went to Vladivostok in their miserable attempt to overthrow Kolchak, but the Army destroyed them. Soon after, workers in Chita gave up. The Transamur Lives and Marches On with its Supreme Leader - Admiral Kolchak."
trmnra.40.a: "Long Live Admiral Kolchak!"

trmnra.41.t: "Socialist Coup in Transamur"
trmnra.41.d: "One of our main allies - Transamur - has fallen under red banner of someone named Kalashnikov. It is absolutely correct that they will try to cut our economic ties with former Transamurian government. We could intervene directly or do nothing."
trmnra.41.a: "We should watch them closely."


trmnra.7.t: "Anti-Japanese Propaganda"
trmnra.7.d: "The Japanese influenced our country for too long, but there is one thing that Kolchak's corrupt government did not know. We hate Japanese and we want our independence. Moreover, we want independence for all workers that suffered under the Japanese boot."
trmnra.7.a: "Exploitators aren't friends!"

trmnra.8.t: "Destroy Japanese Influence"
trmnra.8.d: "After the Revolution, we seized the means of production and prohibited private property, but it is not enough for destroying the Japanese influence completely. They still have military access to our country and we believe that they are still hoping to reinstall their colonial government. We should do something!"
trmnra.8.a: "Close the borders with Japan, secury our maritime boundary and tear all the treaties."

trmnra.42.t: "Transamur Closed The Border"
trmnra.42.d: "The new socialist government of Transamur has tried to destroy our influence in the region, but they did not think that they are surrounded by sea."
trmnra.42.c: "Naval Embargo their vessels"

trmnra.43.t: "Japanese Naval Blockade"
trmnra.43.d: "After our actions, the Japanese has naval blockaded us. While this will greatly increase our import cost, we should rely on ourselves. They won't break us."
trmnra.43.a: "Stay strong."



trmnra.11.t: "Purge The Army"

trmnra.16.t: "The Last Bastion of Bolshevism"
trmnra.16.d: "With the defeat of the Reds in the Civil War, the lands of the first socialist republic in teh world has been a dangerous zone for socialists. Many of them escaped to France and other socialist nations, but some stayed. Our leader, [ROOT.GetLeader] is one of them. And he will say with pride that the Far-Eastern Republic is the Last Bastion of the Bolshevism, but not the least.\n\nThis brings up a new discussion, however. Some consider that the Far-Eastern Republic in its current state is the only possible and durable way to prolong Bolshevism. So comrade Blyukher suggest that he should step down and invite comrade Krasnoschyokov lead a civilian government in the Far-East. The second choice, however, is to proclaim Russian Socialist Republic in-exile and try to restore the real Soviet power all across the Russia. The third choice, is to keep Transamur under military rule of Blyukher until further notion..."
trmnra.16.a: "Long Live Comrade Krasnoschyokov!"
trmnra.16.b: "Prepare the restoration of Russian Socialism."
trmnra.16.c: "Keep the military government."

trmnra.17.t: "A message from the Far-East."
trmnra.17.d: "The Far-Eastern Republic is asking to join us in a close union - but their leader, comrade Blyukher wishes to stay as the head of state. We respect those who fought against Kolchak and we should probably have a buffer zone between us and Japan."
trmnra.17.a: "Accept the deal."

trmnra.18.t: "Transamur Has Cut Ties With Us!"
trmnra.18.d: "Transamur has announced today that they will cut ties with our empire and forge a new path, alone. This comes as a shock to many in Japan who view the state of Transamur as one of Japan's foremost colonies and allies. Regardless, we will not take this insult lightly."
trmnra.18.a: "Damn Russians!"

trmnra.19.t: "[SOV.GetNameDef] Funds an Armed Revolt Against Our Government"

trmnra.21.t: "The Coup Succeeds"
trmnra.21.d: "Unfortunately, there were too many of them. They killed our soldiers and seized administrative buildings in largest cities. [TRM.GetLeader] has been murdered and red banners were hung out. The next day the Soviet forces have crossed the border and established full control of our territories. However, now we shall decide what to do next."

trmnra.58.d: "Just last night there was an explosion at a weapons factory in Blagoveshchensk, which destroyed an entire weapons production line. According to reports from the scene, there were no fatalities, but there were injuries among the workers. None other than the NRA claimed responsibility for the attack, claiming that their attack was aimed at undermining Japan's position in our country. It will take time to rebuild the destroyed industry, but our citizens are getting more and more tired of the violence every day. If we want to regain the support of our people, we must destroy the NRA as soon as possible before they take more drastic measures."

The bomb severely damaged the plant and also damaged local infrastructure. None other than the NRA claimed responsibility for the attack, which claimed that the purpose of the attack was to hit Japanese businesses in the country. Although the response of local firefighters and police is admirable, many locals are extremely alarmed and some even accuse the Lithuanian government of inaction. There is even a growing murmur that the government's actions in recent days are only provoking the NRA to organize more terrorist attacks. If we want to regain the trust of our people, we must redouble our efforts to show the people that we can protect them!"
trmnra.59.a: "We will prevail!"

trmnra.60.t: "Railway Bombing"
trmnra.60.d: "Residents along the Trans-Siberian Railway woke up to a loud explosion and a cloud of smoke in the middle of the night. Apparently, the IRA terrorists struck quickly in the dark and just as quickly fled into the Lithuanian forests. The implication of their attack is clear: the rail lines in Siberia play a key supply role, and without them the troops in Transbaikalia would have difficulty with food and ammunition. Although we will send recovery crews to get our trains up and running more quickly, the latest attack reflects the increasingly violent nature of the NRA. We will make sure that when we find them, they pay for their crimes."
trmnra.60.a: "We will catch them!"

trmnra.61.t: "Failed Attack"
trmnra.61.d: "Today the military command in Vladivostok was absolutely delighted when the news of the actual victory reached them. It turns out that in their conceited arrogance the NRA dogs had attempted to raid a small military outpost near Chita in broad daylight. Most likely, they intended to raid the base solely for supplies, since they were on the run and were probably running out of fuel for their so-called rebellion. After a silly strike on the base, the defenders fired from fortified positions and towers littered with sandbags, fighting off NRA forces like fish in a barrel. Finally, after suffering significant losses, the IRA again fled, but not immediately, leaving their wounded and fallen comrades behind. News of the victory reached the streets of every Lithuanian town, and the military and government praised the response. At last we had a great success, a testament to the strength of our government and the loyalty of our military to [ROOT.GetLeader]!"
trmnra.61.a: "Good riddance."


tramsem.1.t: "Ataman Semyenov"
tramsem.1.d: "Ataman Semenov, the leader of the Transbaikal Cossacks, did not recognize the Kolchak government during the Civil War. After the founding of Transamur, he really wanted to join us, subjecting the entire Transbaikalia region to our jurisdiction. In the conditions of an actual civil war in the region, we can give Transbaikalia under the full control of Semenov. Temporarily, until he puts things in order there. We can be sure that Semenov will cope with the suppression of the troubles in Transbaikalia. However, there are rumors that Semyonov is coordinated by Japan, and Kolchak is concerned that Semyonov may rebel with the help of the Japanese. Something has to be done."

tramsem.4.t: "Turmoil in Transbaikalia"
tramsem.4.d: "The Transbaikal region is a springboard for constant resistance to the Kolchak regime. On the one hand, the region is home to the Buryat-Mongolian minority - the Buddhist people living here. During the civil war, the Buryat-Mongolian state existed for some time as an independent state. With the annexation of Transbaikalia to Transamur, the activities of the local Buryat-Mongolian self-government were suspended, but power in the region was still concentrated in the hands of civilian Siberian regionalists.\n\nIn addition to the Buryat Mongols and local regionalists, the lands of the Transbaikal Cossack army of Semenov are located in Transbaikalia and the NRA partisans are most concentrated. In fact, the region is in a state of civil war, and we need to decide what to do."
tramsem.4.a: "We should deal with the situation."

But in essence, it doesn't change anything).\nSo what are these principles? It is difficult to give an exhaustive description in a short article. But it is possible to outline the general features. Let us summarize them in seven statements.\n1) Freedom of conscience and cults.\n2) Freedom of speech, of thought, of the press, and of scientific creativity. \n3) Political freedom - for all, and especially for the opposition.  Where there is no opposition, there is no democracy. The presence or absence of opposition is one of the most striking criteria. It is absurd to say that democracy gives freedom only to supporters of the ruling majority (and sometimes they add the ruling minority). Any government gives its supporters freedom and encouragement, and a special one - undemocratic. The question of the limits of permissible opposition (in democracies) is decided in reality, i.e., by the psychology of society, its cultural and legal concepts.\n4) Representative institutions are effective and real, not formal and fictitious.\n5) Free elections.\n6) A responsible ministry. \n7) Independent courts.\nAnd again, - responsible government, independent courts - all this is difficult to define formally, but it is absolutely real to "feel", to "experience"."

trammlad.5.t: "Healthy National Consciousness"
trammlad.5.d: "The most reliable guarantee and at the same time an absolutely necessary condition of correct and durable solution of all questions of state life, under any circumstances, is a healthy national consciousness, inherent, if not in the whole nation, at least in its leading stratum. But a healthy national consciousness depends, first of all, on the degree of rootedness in it of some prerequisites, representing, as it were, the foundation of the state existence of a nation. The firmness of these prerequisites in the national consciousness is the first condition for the viability of the state. Therefore, everything that contradicts them, that creates precedents that undermine their firmness in the perception of people, that serves to weaken their clearness in the national consciousness - all this should be rejected without any hesitation, and no circumstances, no considerations, no aims can justify it. For it is absurd, for the sake of salvation of the state, to undermine its most basic viability, to attack the very sources of its existence. Likewise, it is absurd, for the sake of the struggle for one's faith, to violate, distort, and discard its most basic requirements and precepts.\nIt seems to us that the most basic, most necessary prerequisite, without the presence of which in the national consciousness is simply unthinkable the very existence of a great and viable state, is faith in the fatherland itself. This belief consists of two elements: firstly, the belief that the independent existence, development and greatness of the Fatherland is a value of the highest order, and secondly, the belief in the spiritual and physical strength of the nation, that it is worthy of the great historical lot and is able to cope in its own strength with the historical mission which has fallen to its lot. Note, by the way, that the faith of the Russian nation in its own eyes, in the eyes of all its constituent parts, all the tribes and nationalities that make it up, serves, in particular, as the main factor serving the existence of Russia as a unified state. It is the fall of this prestige that underlies all the separatist currents, all the centrifugal forces of our time.\nAs every living organism, every healthy and viable nation has a natural instinct for self-preservation. And so, in a nation that has achieved in its cultural development a state existence, this instinct is inseparable, say, merges with faith in one's fatherland. It generates this faith, but is also generated and strengthened by it. Moreover, it is reborn by it from an ordinary instinct belonging only to the subconscious, to a conscious and reasonable aspiration. For only faith can push into this instinct a healthy meaning and give it a reasonable justification and justification in the eyes of people. But in a healthy nation living a state life, the instinct of self-preservation finds concrete expression, first of all, in the fact that all aspirations of this nation are subordinated to the desire to preserve and ensure the independence and security of its country, in its entirety. Practically, the predominance of this aspiration over all others is expressed in unswerving fidelity, conscious or unconscious, to the principles demanding of us: 1) to guard at all costs and in preference to all other matters the sovereignty of our fatherland, 2) to protect the integrity of its territory and 3) to uphold, under all circumstances, its prestige, both outside and inside. \nOutside these principles, there can be no faith in the fatherland, no national pride, no true national consciousness at all."

trammlad.8.d: "Eurasianism is a movement that emerged after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, interpreting it as a revolt of the people against a Europeanized elite. Eurasians argue that Russia is neither Europe nor Asia, but something third: Eurasia. Saying that Russian statehood originates not only from Kievan Rus, but also from the Golden Horde, they preach a unique way of Russia, which belongs neither to Europe nor to Asia. And so we turn to them for support of our movement. But the Eurasian Party is a party of many people, so we have to decide with whom we should try to establish links. On the one hand, the most obvious option is to try to connect with Trubetskoy, because he is the head of the party, and if he supports us, then the whole Eurasian Party with him. But there is one thing - we have too few points of contact with him, so such an alliance is unlikely to last long. On the other hand, there is a small number of so-called left-wing Eurasians in the party, led by Dmitry Svyatopolk-Mirsky and Roman Jakobson, which are closer to our social views, but anti-monarchist. And now we have to decide with whom it is better for us to establish contacts - Trubetskoy or Svyatopolk-Mirsky and Jakobson."

trammlad.11.d: "Life teaches us that the eternal ideals of people, be it the ideal of a tribe, a nation or a people, find their brightest expression at one-man rule, and exactly in that case, when the leadership belongs to a person, indicated by a rooted custom from time immemorial, - as if by nature itself, prepared for it. And such a person, not in the measure of his personal merits, but precisely because of his high purpose, is more capable than others of comprehending the common ideals and of selfless service to them. Thus, the care for the children of their parents is, in general, more meaningful and effective than the work of strangers, even if very good. Children may not think of their parents as human beings, the very best - that would be naive. But children feel, and in general they are right, that their parents, precisely in relation to them, their children, are better than other people. These kinds of considerations apply to every kind of historically established one-man rule. The monarchical power is, in fact, based on the signs of the expediency of such one-man rule. By its meaning and the character of its origin, monarchic power is possible only in conditions of an organic dormitory of people, in other words, in such a dormitory, which as a result of its long existence has found unity and, in that very field of its life, where it came to undivided authority and worked out a leader for itself. And since the monarchical power is based on universal unity, its expediency is aggravated by the indisputable fact that wherever the goals and the means of achieving them are clear, the one-man rule is always the most effective and fruitful. At least by virtue of such a purely practical consideration, the ideal of conciliar life requires monarchy. But if the power of the monarch, completing the unity of the nation, is, above all, the expression and stronghold of its ideals, it is clear that in his actions the monarch is not free, but subordinated to them, to these ideals."
trammlad.11.a: "Long live the Tsar!"

trammlad.12.t: "Russia's Ascendency..."
trammlad.12.d: "This circumstance, which distinguishes his power from the absolute power, which does not know any barriers and rules solely by its own understanding and will, is the most essential feature of the Russian understanding of monarchy, of that monarchy which has been called autocratic in our country from time immemorial. In this state of affairs, the monarch appears as if he were the executor, not of the will of his contemporaries, but of the collective will of the nation as a whole. Therefore his power cannot be called executive in the usual sense of the word. However, for the monarch to carry the burden of power successfully, he must have a close connection with the nation as a whole, with its past, present, and future. After all, the essence of monarchical power is, in fact, the complete unity of the nation with its leader. This unity is also required by the Russian national ideals, which the monarch serves. Thus, according to the Russian understanding of monarchy, the tsar must be Orthodox. The Orthodox understanding of ecclesiality requires the participation of all believers in revealing the will of God. The Orthodox Church, then, is a conciliar church. And a universal understanding of God's will creates especially favorable conditions for an autocratic monarchy. True autocracy, in its purely Russian sense, contrary to the despotic absolutism of Western monarchies, is possible only under Orthodoxy. According to the Russian understanding of monarchy, the tsar can be only one who has been determined to do so by the church order, - who has been determined to do so by fate, but not by men. The tsar, like the father, must be "natural. The centuries-old common life of the nation and of the dynasty that heads it contributes to their spiritual unity and makes that the ideals of the nation, in the creation and development of which the dynasty participates not only indisputably, but also enormously, receive their most vivid expression, precisely, in the dynasty - become its patrimonial patrimony. And it is through the dynasty that the monarch finds himself linked to the entire past of his nation.\nTime relates a nation to its dynasty, - time fills their life together with mutual understanding and trust, mutual love and a sense of responsibility for each other. Time destroys the monarch's dependence on the people, on their will, and thus puts him in the conditions most conducive to his impartiality and therefore to justice. But even more than independence from the will of his subjects, the monarch needs constant and lively communication with them. For communication is the source of all unity. Where there is no communication, there is no unity, and where there is no unity, there is no monarchy. The communication of the monarch with his subjects unites them spiritually, and every single moment not only protects what has been created - their spiritual unity - but also continues to create this unity, nourishes it, extending it to everything new, which the ever-changing life puts forward."
trammlad.12.a: "Long live the Tsar!"

trammlad.13.t: "Russia's Ascendency..."
trammlad.13.d: "The feeling and consciousness of this calamity will inevitably spread among the subjects, for each of them, in one way or another, is the holder of national ideals... But Russian history knows almost no such moments. Since the monarch combines an understanding of national ideals and loyalty to them with impartiality and justice, since the voluntary submission of his contemporaries is both natural and beneficial, because it makes it possible to implement what the nation needs most - its spiritual unity. But the monarch does not see violence as the way to establishing unity.\nHe must allow everyone to participate freely in the search for truth, and only in cases of irreconcilable disagreement must he point to the opinion he considers, to whomever it may belong, the most correct. And universal agreement with the monarch's direction will be erected on a universal desire for truth and unity, either on the consciousness of the justice of the monastic judgment, or on humility before the idea that unity is necessary, that only by such agreement can it be saved, that there is no other way to unity, and indeed there cannot be. In view of the fact that the general and, so to speak, supra-temporary interests of the nation are above the local and temporary interests of its various parts, the voice of the monarch must be central to the political life of the nation, in other words, the supreme power must belong to the monarch. If we consider that the monarch defends before his contemporaries the interests of the nation as a whole, - the interests of its past, present and future, and if we extend the idea of formal democracy to the totality of all the members of the nation - dead, living and not yet born - it becomes clear that the monarch stands in the majority and that he, alone, must have the upper hand over all his contemporaries, taken together. Such a consideration, however, being based on the recognition of the superiority of the majority over the minority, not of truth over error, is not consistent with the spirit of cathedral life and does not seem worthy of consideration. The universal and free search for truth, with the monarch acting as supreme judge in the struggle of various feelings and opinions, is the only way to the spiritual unity of the nation. That said, the function of the monarch is what they now like to call arbitration. The monarch, it is the supreme arbiter. But arbitration does not exhaust the significance that the monarch has in the conciliar life of the nation.\nHis participation in the discussion of questions that threaten universal unity ennobles the council's activity, imparting to it the spirit of the search for truth and justice, in other words, giving it that moral direction which alone can lead men to unity. Arbitration is a matter of supreme authority. The supreme authority is subject only to the ideals it is called upon to serve. In this sense an autocratic monarch is not bound by the will of his subjects. But he is bound to lead them on the path of spiritual unity, to listen to their opinions and to decide by conscience where truth lies. And we know that the supreme power's rejection of this\nThus, the autocratic monarchy not only relies on the spiritual unity of the nation, but also creates it. The growth of national unity and the education and creative life of an autocratic monarchy are inseparable processes, each depending on the other, and each conditioning the other."

trammlad.147.t: "The Union of Mladorossi"
trammlad.147.d: "The history of the "Young Russian" movement is inexorably tied to its leader, the charismatic aristocrat Alexander Lvovich Kazem-Bek, born in 1902 to a wealthy noble family of Azeri and Iranian origin. The three ideological phases of the Mladorossi can be closely mapped to Kazem-Bek's own life and experience; unsurprisingly considering his role as orator and ideologist. As a student activist, Kazem-Bek helped form the "Union of Young Russia" in 1923. Uniting 29 organisations and 4,000 people, the Young Russians represented the monarchist youth wing. Prone to intellectualism and ideologically vague, its members jointly rejected reactionary Tsarism in favour of a "new and dynamic vision". As secretary, Kazem-Bek met with Professor Nikolai Ustryalov, once head of the press bureau under Admiral Kolchak. Ustryalov convinced the young aristocrat to throw his support behind the putsch against President Kerensky in 1924. Both fled to Transamur following the coup's failure, taking their respective supporters along with them. Ustryalov became disillusioned with the White movement, and began idolising the Bolsheviks as defenders of Russian sovereignty.\n\nThe formation of the "Union of Young Russians" in 1925 marked the second ideological phase of the Mladorossi. Kazem-Bek began formulating his thesis of the "Labor Monarchy" under Ustryalov's tutelage. The nascent ideology of the Mladorossi combined an absolute monarchy, Soviet democracy, Orthodox Integralism, Russian nationalism and the "revolutionary spirit". During this period of 1925-1933, most Mladorossi were united only by theatrical oath-swearing ceremonies and readership of journals such as "Vivacity!" and "Towards Young Russia". The third phase occurred shortly after Kazem-Bek's travels to the Syndicalist nations of Europe. Kazem-Bek was particularly inspired by the proto-Totalism of the French & Italian national syndicalists, as well as the British Mosleyites. On his return, Kazem-Bek formed the "Mladoross Party" in 1934 as its "Vozhd". His ideas on how to organise the Young Russian State have coalesced into a single-party corporatist model under a Worker-Monarch.\n\nWith a strict party structure and growing paramilitary wing, Kazem-Bek hopes to achieve control of Transamur, and then his beloved homeland, Russia."

Formed in 1931 by local politician and Kolchak loyalist, Anastasiy Vonsyatsky, the Natsionalisty have found support amongst Manchurian Russians and monarchist exiles. Young emigres still loyal to the ideals of a Russian Tsardom have flocked to this movement in awe of Vonsyatsky’s fiery speeches denouncing Bolshevism, Kerensky and Western Capitalism. All of which he accuses of degenerating the Russian people whilst declaring loyalty to Admiral Kolchak, the Russian Orthodox Church and a restored Tsardom. Espousing the homegrown ideology of “True Russian Nationalism”, the Natsionalisty have organised its members into a paramilitary force known as the, Black Vanguard, undoubtedly a reference to the Black Hundred.\n\n The Black Vanguard have provided security to Kolchak’s regime and have engaged in rounding up political dissidents as well as prominent members of the Jewish Vladivostok community accused of promoting ''dangerous foreign ideologies''. Admiral Kolchak has allowed for these actions to take place without officially endorsing the movements, perhaps to appease the Japanese authorities wary of an anti-foreign movement."

But, Kazem-Bek still holds out hope that a Romanov Claimant will approach us and let us crown him Tsar. However, one positive is that Kazem-Bek’s position has never been stronger, as there is no Tsar that reigns technically above him; even though the Tsar would hold little real power.

Their Devil-Tsar Nicholas II was by far the worst Tsar he ever had allowing his wife to be seduced by the devil Rasputin and doing nothing of it! He himself was a weak sheep allowing anyone and anything to tell him what to do. The Kulak Industrialists told him to not let Brusilov destroy the German Aggressors! The Kulak Industrialists told him to abdicate so they can save their own skins! The Kulak Industrialists DEMANDED to not go to England so he could die!

An army that will stand shoulder to shoulder, prepared to die for their leader and nation. An army that would follow the Vozhd to the Gates of Hell without ever questioning an order. That is an army of which Kazem-Bek has forged, the Blueshirts, named due to their dark blue shirts along with red armbands and white trousers. These titans of men represent the strength required to restore the Russian Tsardom, but these men are no elitist sycophants that have previously stood behind a Tsar. The Blueshirts are composed of rugged working-class proletariat workers who have evolved out of the brawls in the streets of Vladivostok and into disciplined soldiers waving the banner of Russia and the Mladorossi. Inspired by both Ivan the Terrible’s devoutly loyal Oprichniki and the ultrnationalist militias of the Black Hundreds, they may lack expert training and state of the art equipment however they make up for it with their faith in mother Russia!"

However not all was lost! In Russia’s darkest hour there stood one man who would not go quietly into that good night. Alexander Kazem-Bek held within him a fiery passion that struck a light in the minds and souls of working patriots across the Russian lands. He rejected the spiralling crash brought upon by bickering factions of lifeless hordes eager to tear eachother apart in the name of power and greed! Kazem-Bek rallied those fellow brave nationalists and together they defeated the enemy within! Russia has ascended beyond its stagnant state, no longer the sickman of the globe. The heart of Russia is the heart of the Mladorossi, the movement has become Russia’s new identity. And as Kazem-Bek’s fearsome rhetoric grows ever more dominant over the minds of many, so does Russia. The future belongs to us comrades!“\n\n- Front page of today’s edition of the Toward Young Russia newspaper"

trammlad.514.d: "Some crazy fanatic today made an attempt on our Leader, Alexander Kazem-Bek. The damned criminal, despite the blue-shirts surrounding Kazem-Bek, was able to break through almost at point-blank range to the Vozhd and fire several shots at the Vozhd!\n\nQuickly torn apart by an angry crowd, the terrorist was never recognized, his motives and political affiliation remain unknown...\n\nThe seriously wounded leader was sent to a hospital in Vladivostok, where the best doctors of Transamur will fight for his life."

trammlad.515.d: "Even the best doctors of Transamur could not save the life of our leader. A few bullets of a freak, a pervert, a heretic - and there is no more man.\n\nThe death of the Vozhd overtook us in difficult times, and so far there is no replacement for him, except for a new Leader - Wonsyatsky, who agreed to take responsibility for the country and the people in such a difficult time for her.\n\nSeven days of mourning will be declared throughout the country, flags will be lowered at half-mast, while Wonsyatsky will prepare for the sacred oath of the Regent."

trammlad.516.d: "Soon after the death of Kazem-Bek, the new Far-Eastern government, led by Vonsyatsky, has rapidly started to 'renovate' the state. To the great surprise of many, the red banner of the Mladorossi was lowered, and the Nationalist party flag was raised to replace it.\nIn addition to reshuffling the government, many Mladorossi were soon dismissed from their posts and replaced with Nationalist candidates. But that was just the beginning. The beginning of the end of the Mladorossi.\n\nVery soon, mass purges began. Not limiting themselves to dismissals, the Nationalists began to arrest Mladorossi, and the leaders of local units, according to rumors, were executed without trial. Soon the Mladorossi were officially declared "Enemies of the Crown", their flags were seized and burned in the central square of Vladivostok.\n\nNationalist flags with huge Turtles were hung on almost every building, and Vonsyatsky was portrayed in the media as a great leader, the only one who could save Russia from Bolshevism and Kerenshchina."

trammlad.517.t: "The Chetvertorossi Union"
trammlad.517.d: "Shortly after the death of Kazem-Bek, the new leader Wonsyatsky announced the creation of the so - called "Union of Chetvertorossi" - in fact, a party coalition of Mladorossi and Nationalists.\n\nThe Chetvertorossi, in the words of the Vozhd himself, are the best sons of the Motherland, fighting for the fourth way - rejecting Tsarism, Bolshevism and Democracy. The fourth way is the way of the Russian People. United by the Tsar and the Vozhd, the power of the working masses fighting for a nation humiliated by the Japanese and Germans, betrayed by the allies.\n\nLong live our great union, for its path will light up the whole of Russia. And when a huge army of Black Vanguard will stand at the walls of the ancient Kremlin, and the benevolent Tsar will sit on the throne, Russia will be mighty and great."

trammlad.518.t: "Private Talk With DO-ROVS Leaders"
trammlad.518.d: "Today, the Nationalists held a meeting with representatives of the DO-ROVS, which was attended by the Vozhd Vonsyatsky himself. The Nationalist Party proposed the cooperation of the DORS in the struggle against the Petrograd regime, setting one of its main goals as the restoration of the monarchy and the return of the Tsar to the throne, which should have pleased some of those present.\n\nBy the evening, the meeting was over, but there was no response from the DO-ROVS yet, but they promised to give an answer soon."
trammlad.518.a: "Let's wait."

trammlad.519.t: "DO-ROVS Join Us In Our Fight!"
trammlad.519.d: "The leader of the DO-ROVS sent a personal telegram to the Vozhd, in which he declared the resolute readiness of the DO-ROVS and the entire command staff to join the struggle against the Petrograd regime, recognize Vonsyatsky as the Vozhd and together return the tsarist dynasty to the throne."
trammlad.519.a: "Excellent!"

trammlad.520.t: "DO-ROVS Refused Cooperation!"
trammlad.520.d: "The leader of the DO-ROVS sent a personal telegram to the Vozhd, in which he stated that the DO-ROVS would never recognize Vonsyatsky as the Vozhd, since the organization pursues other goals. They recognized that cooperation with the Mladorossi is unacceptable, whatever it may be, and they remember this."
trammlad.520.a: "They will regret this!"

trammlad.521.t: "The Black Vanguard Purges DO-ROVS Out Of Transamur!"
trammlad.521.d: "Soon after the DO-ROVS officially refused to cooperate with the Nationalists, it became known about the attack on their base in Nikolaevsk, and riots and looting in the city center. The base itself, with paramilitary detachments of the Armed Forces stationed there, was subjected to an armed attack, as a result of which many of the soldiers were killed.\n\nIn addition, all the representatives of the highest general staff of the Armed Forces were found and arrested, who were also shot for treason. Key outposts on the Trans-Siberian Railway were soon captured by the Black Vanguard, ensuring free access of Nationalists to Yakutia and Transbaikalia."
trammlad.521.a: "They deserved it!"

trammlad.522.t: "A Letter to Denikin"
trammlad.522.d: "The Vozhd Vonsyatsky personally sent a letter to General Denikin and urged him to join the troops of the true Russian army. He reminded him that he served in the Volunteer Army under him and remembers how they went together to the death battle against the Bolsheviks. the Vozhd also indicated that he was waiting for the generals closest to Denikin who were capable of feats in the name of the Russian nation."
trammlad.522.a: "Yours faithfully, Vozhd."

trammlad.523.t: "No Response From Petrograd"
trammlad.523.d: "A month has passed, but the Vozhd has not received a response from General Denikin, and this can only mean that either the letter did not reach, which is unlikely, or that it did not come, which is also unlikely. However, according to the Vozhd, the most likely thing is that Denikin is a coward, a scoundrel and a scumbag who hates the Russian nation and is ready to serve the German bastards.\n\nThere will be no place for such people in the new Russia."
trammlad.523.a: "He will be hanged when we capture Moscow"

trammlad.524.t: "The Old General Arrives"
trammlad.524.d: "The letter from Denikin still did not come, and the Vozhd was even beginning to be disappointed in his former commander, when suddenly he was informed that a ship had arrived at Vladivostok, on which disguised generals, including Denikin, were present.\n\nSoon Denikin himself came to Vonsyatsky, where they had a conversation, and Denikin declared his readiness to fight for the Russian idea."
trammlad.524.a: "Good to know."

trammlad.525.t: "Denikin And His Confederates Leave For Transamur"
trammlad.525.d: "Today knew that General Denikin, along with his associates, left the country. According to intelligence, they went to Vladivostok, where they will most likely join the newly-made 'Vozhd'"
trammlad.525.a: "Traitors!"

trammlad.526.t: "The House of Romanovs in Transamur"
trammlad.526.d: "The streets were empty and deserted, only sometimes the Black Vanguard marched along them, singing " Banners Above!", the party anthem of the Nationalists.\n\nAn important meeting was held today in one of the merchant houses, which was attended by the opposed Nationalists and some representatives of the royal Romanov dynasty. The Vozhd of Vonsyatsky talked for a long time with one of the candidates for tsar, and it seems that they found a common language. In general, all of the candidates present expressed their support for the Nationalists and were ready, in the words of the Leader, to sacrifice themselves for the victory of the Russian people, whatever that means. In any case, the so-called "Regency Council", consisting mainly of Vonsyatsky's closest associates and himself, should decide on the coronation of the new tsar."
trammlad.526.a: "Kirill Vladimirovich shall lead the nation!"
trammlad.526.b: "Vladimir Kirillovich shall lead the nation!"
trammlad.526.c: "Andrei Aleksandrovich shall lead the nation!"

trammlad.532.t: "[ROOT.GetLeader] Crowned As A Tsar"
trammlad.532.d: "Inside one of the buildings of Vladivostok, rich Vladivostok Politicians, Industrial Figures and Socialites gathered together to have a party albeit, a small party. Here [ROOT.GetLeader] is now crowned Tsar of Siberia and All of Russias. There was no celebrating and partying at all, followed by a small military parade of Siberian Army and Black Vanguard. It ended quietly soon after with the formal coronation of the Tsar himself and a speech from Vonsyatsky about bringing Russia into a modernity and bringing it to its Greatest time since the time of Elizabeth the Great."
trammlad.532.a: "Long Live Tsar! Long Live Vozhd!"

trammlad.533.t: "Of Turtles and Men"
trammlad.533.d: "Sitting in his meticulously organized study as a Rachmaninoff symphony played in the background, Vozhd Vonsiatsky weaved his deft and delicate hands in a blur as he painted something at his desk. A well-known lover of all things Testudine, Vonsiatsky was not painting on a canvas of fiber or paper, but of shell! Keeping a large personal menagerie of various tortoise and turtle species in his home all scattered about in different ponds, gardens, and tanks around the estate, Vonsiatsky adores the small creatures, and has picked up a rather odd hobby relating to them. \n\nThough it is sometimes normal for people to paint the shells of their pet turtles, our Vozhd has taken it further, painting the globus cruciger symbol of the Mladorossi movement on their shells and parading them around as party mascots. Our Vozhd has taken this so far that he even wears a small turtle pin on his lapel and brings a few of these painted propaganda turtles along with him wherever he goes to spread the message and notoriety of our new creed. Whatever his reasoning is for loving these odd and slow creatures - which he calls his own ‘tank corp’ - is unknown, but they have become a symbol of our new movement all the same."
trammlad.533.a: "What an odd hobby."

trammlad.527.t: "The Shadow of the Oblique Turtle"
trammlad.527.d: "Along with the power of the nationalists came severe discipline. The streets of Far Eastern cities are now quiet and clean, without tramps and drunks. The buildings are decorated with white-blue-red banners with a Turtle, and the Black Vanguard, which has received permission to carry out law enforcement activities from the Vozhd himself, walks along the streets.\n\nThis is a country of light, where the Pacific sun shines on the bright faces of people, Russian people, where only occasionally you can see the faces of the Japanese who have not yet had time to leave, cowardly scurrying through the alleys. The Russian nation has risen. But it's damp and cold in the shadow of the Turtle. In the shadow of the Turtle, people are taken from their homes, beaten and arrested for criticizing the party and the Vozhd. But this is our new reality. And she can not but please a simple Russian peasant."
trammlad.527.a: "Russian people, arise!"

trammlad.528.t: "Eradicating Japanese Influence" 
trammlad.528.d: "The distrust of the Japanese community within our nation has always been known, and the Natsionalisty has been furthering this by branding the Japanese as traitors in hiding, agents of a foreign government and those who are keeping the Russians down with their control of the banks. These rallies and speeches acted as a gas canister being poured onto wooden logs before a fire, with uniformed members of the Natsionalisty organizing marches through Japanese settlements and drawing the rising sun on Japanese owned businesses, identifying to the entire city who it was owned by. \n\nThis was the beginning of course, with the gasoline only needing a spark to be lit, and today that spark has been provided. The distant horizon held a shadow play of flames and smoke coming from the burning Japanese homes, where their businesses were set aflame by Natsionalisty crowds and people out in the street at the time were beaten savagely. The night proved to be long and terrifying to those sheltering down in their homes, hoping fire would not be lit to them. At long last however, the crowds dispersed and the military appeared, initially thought to be restoring order, but they ended up proving to be a bitter end to the Japanese community that greeted them when they ordered them to mount trucks. They were being relocated for their own ‘safety’, safety that would just so happen to be conveniently located across the border outside Russia." 
trammlad.528.a: "The threat within, the threat without."

trammlad.530.t: "SLAVA!" 
trammlad.530.d: "Anastasy Vonsyatsky, the Vozhd of our great nation, and why would he not be? This is the man who restored our nation to greatness. He himself fought against the red menace years ago, and even after that work was done decided to continue his efforts against the poison that is bolshevism by organizing the Natsionalisty here in Vladivostok. Preaching the truth of what is necessary to return Russia to greatness and defeat the Germans, Japanese and the Red menace that lurks in the shadows. Now the Tsar himself sits restored, a feat we only have to thank Anastasy for! \n\nSo for this, the nation must be thankful. Within the streets of our capitol sit great portraits of Vonsyatsky, Our nation’s families thanking him for their bread while our troops shall have thoughts of what he has done for our nation while they fight for it. There shall not be a moment where our people are not reminded of what he has done for them and his greatness, as school children shall sing songs of his deeds while aspiring to be able to prove their loyalty to a man they have everything to be grateful for, because who else would give the children of our nation an education, if not for the Vozdh? Everyone who loves their nation and the rebirth it has undergone shall cheer thrice these increasingly common words." 
trammlad.530.a: "Hail Vozhd!"

At the same time, the region has a local civilian government of Oblastniki and Buryats, who view Verkhneudinsk as their native and rightful home.\nMoreover, the region is filled with NRA partisans who try to provoke and sabotage either of the present political groups.§!"
TRM_Chita_TITLE: "§LChita is a large transport hub, which brings together a lot of Far-Eastern workers and, therefore, NRA partisans. What is more, local Chita Oblastniki are also a powerful force in the region, who are engaged in the power struggle with the local Master of Chita...\nThe region is under an undisputed control of Ataman Semyenov, who constantly terrorizes NRA and Oblastniki and builds a strong Cossack Host.

TRM_Khabarovsk_TITLE: "§LThe Region of Khabarovsk was one of the main battlefields during the Civil War. Right now the Ussuri Cossack Host is located here, though its power is very limited due to the fact, that Khabarovsk is located in the so-called 'core Transamur'. The private sector and industry in the city is monopolized by Vladivostok Business Circles, which helps the NRA to bolster socialist sentiments in the region. Even though Khabarovsk is under military control of Kolchak's government, it also has the presence of the Japanese and Fengtian garrisons that ensure regular trading on concessional terms with Vladivostok Business Circle.§!"
TRM_Magadan_TITLE: "§LThe City of Okhotsk was once the main base the main base on the eastern borders of Russia for the flotilla and ships of the Russian-American Company and later became the cradle of the Pacific Fleet. However, the glorious times have passed and now Okhotsk is nothing more than another 'godforsaken place' in the middle of Siberian nowhere. Despite Okhotsk desolation, the Pacific Fleet is still there and is still loyal to the Supreme Ruler and Admiral, making it a cherry on the cake for the Japanese Empire.§!"
TRM_Nikolayevsk_TITLE: "§LDespite the fact that Nikolaevsk is a fairly small city located at the mouth of the Amur River, it is the center of gold mining in the entire Russian Far East and the second most important Far Eastern port.\nThough initially under the Japanese Intervention protection, right now the city of Nikolayevsk and the entire region is the main strongold of the DO-ROVS. Under firm hand of General Diterikhs, the region is becoming a new center of Russian Orthodoxy with radical Holy-Cross divisions being formed from citizens who are willing to fight in the Great Crusade Against... anything Diterikhs deems enough unspiritual§!"
TRM_Vladivostok_TITLE: "§LAh, Vladivostok, the Pacific gate of Russia!\nThe capital city of the Far East is perhaps the only place in the country where its fate is decided. With the Port of Vladivostok under occupation of the Japanese forces and Vladivostok Business Circle, the administrative buildings under 'occupation' of Kolchak Government, the military bases under control of the DO-ROVS, only streets and factories are left, where people are talking only about freedom and equality, inspired by the local Oblastniki and underground NRA resistance.§!"
TRM_Primorye_TITLE: "§LPrimorye, despite being close to the capital city is much less developed, with the Kolchak loyalist forces spread across the region, trying to restore order. The influence of the Japanese and Vladivostok Business is as high here, as in the city of Vladivostok.§!"

The Sakhalin region is not only rich in fish, forest and coal, but also in something, very precious - Oil. As long as Sakhalin is ours, we can be sure that we have cheap fuel for the Pacific Fleet§!"
TRM_Yakutia_TITLE: "§LYakutia, the land of native Yakuts has a long and complex story of relations with Kolchak government. When in November 1918 Yakutia was captured by Kolchak's troops, the local Yakuts never received the autonomy they wanted and anti-Kolchak rebellion succeeded in December 1919. However, the Civil War soon came to an end, bringing back the civilian republican government, which still did nothing with desired Yakut Autonomy. Everything changed in 1925 when Oblastniki seized the initiative and joined the Far-Eastern Republic, establishing Yakut Autonomous Republic. Though Yakutia still stays anti-Kolchak, they will not tolerate his suzerainty over their territory.§!"

According to Ivanov-Razumnik, the history of Russian thought represents the struggle of the creative intelligentsia with 'Soslovnoye Meschanstvo' (\"Omnibus Burghership\") and the spirit of conformism, and only the intelligentsia is able to defeat this urban commoner spirit, bringing liberation to the whole people, first individually, and then also in the social and political plan. His social ideas are close to those of the Left, which makes him not a bad ally for us. It is people like Ivanov-Razumnik who can create in Russia a new, truly popular intelligentsia."

tram_crisis_1936.1.d: "Today in Barguzin, Transbaikalia, our border guards noticed that a plane, apparently belonging to the Russian Air Force, had violated the borders. The latest Japanese Far East fighters were airborne towards it, but the plane could not be tracked - having performed a first-class maneuver, it seemed to disappear in the clouds over Baikal.\n\nImmediately, a note of protest was sent to Petrograd demanding an end to the illegal overflights of the Far East."
tram_crisis_1936.1.a: "We should strengthen our anti-air defence in the region."

tram_crisis_1936.2.d: "Today in Barguzin, Transbaikalia, the Transamurian border guards are said to have noticed that a plane, apparently belonging to the Russian Air Force, had violated the 'borders'. The newest Japanese Far East fighters were airborne towards it, but the plane could not be tracked - having performed a first-class maneuver, it seemed to disappear in the clouds over Baikal.\n\nImmediately, a note of protest was sent to us demanding an end to the illegal overflights of the Far East."

tram_crisis_1936.3.t: "Vitim Incident"
tram_crisis_1936.3.d: "Rumors flew around many Transbaikal newspapers about a ghostly Vitim boat - in a fishing town near the border of the unrecognized [RUS.GetName]. According to local residents, they saw an armored boat of Russian river troops dangerously close to the town at night. The fishermen, frightened by the landing and the outbreak of war, locked themselves in their homes, but just a few minutes later the armored boat disappeared. \n\nThe mysterious incident took place a couple of days ago when the weather was foggy, but some generals from the General Staff believe the story is not fictional and we should be wary of other Russian armored boats."

### 1937 Crisis ###
tram_crisis_1937.1.t: "Slyudyanka Incident"
tram_crisis_1937.1.d: "An emergency telegram from the Minister of Foreign Affairs reached [ROOT.GetLeader] today, assuring that yesterday, 15 km from the \"Slyudyanka\" outpost on our territory, the border patrol noticed two [TRM.GetAdjective] soldiers who were trying to connect to the communication line. The soldier was killed and the non-commissioned officer was detained, and a rifle and a hand-machine gun were taken from the intruders. Shortly thereafter another group of [TRM.GetAdjective] soldiers were seen, who, according to the minister's assurance, were the first to open fire. Several of our border guards were killed in the exchange of fire, but the other side suffered casualties as well.\n\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs placed immediate responsibility for this on the so-called Transamura government and demanded that [ROOT.GetLeader] decide immediately on a preventive strike. It is quite possible that this is what is expected of us in [TRM.Capital.GetName]..."
tram_crisis_1937.1.a: "Demand formal apologies from [TRM.GetName]!"

tram_crisis_1937.2.t: "Slyudyanka Incident"
tram_crisis_1937.2.d: "Yesterday a terrible provocation from the Russian forces happened 15 km from the \"Slyudyanka\" outpost deep in [RUS.GetAdjective] territory. Their minister of foreign affairs has claimed that the border patrol has noticed two of our soliders, who were accused of trying to connect to the communication line. While one of them was killed and the other, a non-commissioned officer, was detained, with rifle and even a hand-machine gun. Moreover, they claimed that shortly thereafter another group of our soldiers were seen on their territory, who, according to their minister's assurance, have opened fire! The armed clashes have soon begun with wounded and killed on both sides. The [RUS.GetLeader] has demanded formal apologies from us for the incident, and it seems like [RUS.GetName] is currently mobilising to make a preventive strike!"
tram_crisis_1937.2.a: "Seems like a provocation!"

tram_crisis_1937.3.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Formal Apologies"
tram_crisis_1937.3.d: "As stated before, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has demanded formal apologies for the 'Slyudyanka Incident'. However, with clear signs of provocation and no real evidence presented to us, [ROOT.GetLeader] has decided that the best tactics right now is to stay silent and not to apologize for actions, they have made up themselves."
tram_crisis_1937.3.a: "Refuse to react on this provocation."

tram_crisis_1937.4.t: "Silence on That End"
tram_crisis_1937.4.d: "Clearly, [TRM.GetAdjective] illegitimate government has refused to react anyhow, neither apologising nor answering our requests. With their violations of our territory each day, it is now becoming clear that a serious confrontation is soon to begin. Having listened to the advice of our Head of Army, [ROOT.GetLeader] has decided to send a division to Transbaikalia, remiding [TRM.GetName] of who should control these territories."
tram_crisis_1937.4.a: "Send one division into Transbaikalia"

tram_crisis_1937.5.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Soldiers Cross Border in Transbaikalia"
tram_crisis_1937.5.d: "Our border guards have just sent an emergency telegram to [ROOT.Capital.GetName] about a large detachment of [RUS.GetAdjective] soliders crossing the borders in Slyudyanka and trying to advance deep in Transbaikalia. While there was no formal declaration of war, there are two choices, presented to [ROOT.GetLeader]. First one - is to defend our territory without violation of what [RUS.GetAdjective] government believes to be 'their territory'. The other choice is to use their stupid provocation and prepare armored boats to naval invade the mouth of Angara river - and possibly taking over Irkutsk and throw back their troops to Nizhneudinsk. While a risky operation, its success can result in winning over another Siberian region for us."
tram_crisis_1937.5.a: "Resist, but defend only our territory."

tram_crisis_1937.6.a: "We must gather our strength to invade again"

tram_crisis_1937.7.t: "[TRM.GetAdjective] Forces Retreat"
tram_crisis_1937.7.d: "We have successfully defeated the [TRM.GetAdjective] border guards, forcing them to retreat. However, we know that this must be a trap to surround us. Instead of moving deep into Transbaikalia, another group of soldiers will now strike North - at try to establish control over the gold-mining district of Bodaybo. Clearly, that will present us in a winning position, as Bodaybo is probably not even defended as all their troops are concentrated in Verkhneudinsk."

tram_crisis_1937.12.d: "The Transbaikal region was a springboard for constant resistance to the Kolchak regime. On the one hand, the region is home to the Buryat-Mongolian minority - the Buddhist people living here. During the civil war, the Buryat-Mongolian state existed for some time as an independent state. With the annexation of Transbaikalia to Transamur, the activities of the local Buryat-Mongolian self-government were suspended, but power in the region was still concentrated in the hands of civilian Siberian regionalists.\n\nIn addition to the Buryat Mongols and local regionalists, the lands of the Transbaikal Cossack army of Semenov are located in Transbaikalia and the NRA partisans are most concentrated. In fact, the region is in a state of civil war, and we need to decide what to do."
