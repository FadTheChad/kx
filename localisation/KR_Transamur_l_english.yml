### Leaders & Traits ###

POLITICS_KYRIL_ROMANOV_TRM_DESC:0 "By the Grace of God, We, Kirill I, Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias, Tsar of Siberia; all of the northern countries Master; and others, and others, and others."
POLITICS_KAZEMBEK_DESC:0"Little would have predicted that Alexander Kazembek would end up in the position he is in today. It seems as if his life may just be a lesson on the instability of the universe; of the chaos of politics and human existence. Born to a noble Iranian-Azerbaijani family, Kazembek saw the brunt of the Russian Revolution; something that undoubtably shaped his eccentric political views. However, instead of turning him against the Soviets, the Revolution endeared in him a certain level of respect for the Soviet System. And even though the Red Revolution failed; Kazembek still incorporated parts of the Soviet Ideals into his personal politics. \n\n His Charisma and experience as an Orator put him at the forefront of the new “Young Russia” group, a group that rejected Reactionary Tsarism in favour of a “New and Dynamic Vision”. As the situation in Russia deteriorated, Professor Nikolai Ustryalov convinced Party Secretary Kazembek to side with Alexander Kolchak and his coup against the Petrograd Government. Kolchak’s coup however failed; resulting in the creation of the state of Transamur; the rump state where Kazembek and Ustryalov fled to. These series of events led to Ustryalov and Kazembek rejecting the ideology of the Whites in favour of the Bolsheviks. This idealization lead to the development of the concept of a “Labour Monarchy”, and a system that combines Soviet democracy, Orthodox Integralism, Russian nationalism and the "revolutionary spirit". And as his Ideology grew and Changed, so did the influence of the Mladorossi within Transamur. Their influence grew and expanded, to a point where they could seize power following the Anti- Kolchak Coup. \n\n Now, Kazembek stands as the “Vozd” of the Rump State of Transamur. And though his influence may be currently small, Kazembek has plans to restore the Tsar, and soon reclaim all of Russia "
POLITICS_KYRIL_ROMANOV_MLAD_DESC:0 "Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, now Kirill I of Russia, is one of the most troublesome members of the House of Romanov. Strong-willed, ambitious, and determined to seize the throne, he has caused a headache to his first cousin, Nikolay II, several times. It is an open secret that during the February Revolution, Kirill actively worked against the Tsar and the rest of the House, even to the point where he ordered his men to raise the red flag above Petrograd - not because of any dedication to revolutionary ideals, but because of the hopes that he would become regent, or possibly even Tsar, after his cousin's abdication. \n\nAfter the execution of Nikolay and his family, Kirill claimed his rule over the scattered house of Romanov, a claim which was hotly contested by the rest of the family, who claimed that Kirill had no right to a restored Russian throne nor to lead the Russian royal family. By 1929, however, he was ultimately recognized, the untimely death of Grand Duke Nikolay certainly helped. While Kirill begrudgingly pays lip service to the Mladorossi, it truly doesn't matter to him who holds the keys to power; as long as he is in charge in some form. Even if Kirill is under practical House Arrest, and not but a powerless figurehead compared to Vozd Kazembek"
POLITICS_ALEXANDR_KOLCHAK_DESC:0 "Once a polar explorer and commander in the Imperial Russian Navy, who had also fought in both the Russo-Japanese War and the Weltkrieg, Kolchak is now the self-proclaimed "Supreme Ruler of Russia" in a puppet quasi-state in the Far East, unsuccessfully trying to throw off the shackles of Japanese imperialism. How did he come to such a life?\n\nWhen the civil war was raging in the vast expanses of Russia, Kolchak, in many ways suddenly for himself, was proclaimed the Supreme Ruler of Russia during the putsch in November 1918. Having first arrested the SRS and declared martial law, the imminent catastrophe was stopped by Boris Savinkov, who agreed with Kolchak on the adoption of the SR agrarian reform. The Whites were united and strong. The Siberian army soon merged with other white armies and by the end of 1919 the Bolsheviks surrendered. Having made a difficult choice in favor of Russia, Kolchak made an equally difficult choice, renouncing the supreme power and approving the Second Constituent Assembly in 1920.\n\nHowever, his relations with the newly created Russian Republic's government were quite hostile due to the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, which they had agreed to and signed, the Japanese Intervention in Transamur and Eastern Karelian Revolt. These relations only worsened in 1925 after Kolchak's unsuccessful coup d'etat against the government of Kerensky's "German lapdogs". The rogue admiral managed to escape from Russia and, ironically, found refuge in the pro-Japanese state of Transamur, the power in which belonged to the Kwantung army and the richest Merkulov family. Having enlisted the support of the ataman of the Transbaikal Cossacks Semenov and the East Siberian Oblastniks, as well as the support of Tokyo, Kolchak again found himself in the chair of the Supreme Ruler, but this time with a clear goal - to finish what he had started and overthrow the Petrograd regime."
POLITICS_SHUMYATSKY_DESC:0 "Boris Shumyatsky's parents were forced into exile in Siberia because they refused to leave their home. This incident has stuck with Shumyatsky, continually reminding him of the corruption within the Tsarist government based in Petrograd. A former Bolshevik, Shumyatsky was forced to leave Russia upon the conclusion of the Russian Civil War and has become an influential politician within Transamur. Despite his political views shifting towards the right, Shumyatsky continues to pursue the goal of turning Transamur into a welfare state. His past experience as a Bolshevik agitator has helped him gain a majority of the votes during the Presidential elections."
POLITICS_MERKULOV_DESC:0 "A former leader of the pro-Japanese Provisional Transamur Government, Merkulov and his brother are the richest people in Transamur. Now, as Kolchak no longer stands in his way and democracy has finally returned to Vladivostok, Merkulov, a son of a humble peasant, is eager to lead Transamur to prosperity. His vast and personal connections with the people have helped him gain a majority of the votes during the Presidential elections."
POLITICS_WOJ_DESC:0 "A leader of Czechoslovakian Legion and hero of the Russian Civil War, Wojciechowski has refused to accept the Brest-Litovsk treaty as legitimate. Outraged, he ceased all the contact with the government of the Russian Republic, and left for Transamur where he found many supporters. Formerly the right-hand man of admiral Kolchak, Sergei betrayed and killed his 'friend'. Less aggressive and ambitious than the rogue admiral, and a hardened veteran, Wojciechowski is now ready to advance West."
POLITICS_SEMYONOV_DESC:0 "An Ataman of the Baikal Cossacks, Semyonov and his boys had managed to establish a Transabaikal state, currently known as Transamur, in order to fight Bolsheviks who had been agitating in the Russian Far East. His newborn country was soon subjugated by Japan. When Kolchak's coup in 1925 had failed and the had rogue admiral had left Russia for Transamur, Semyonov was forced to resign and continue his career as military commander. However, the 'father-of-state' has managed to return, politically influential. Semyonov's only goal is to see Transamur prosper and, in order to do so, he is unwilling to wage uncertain wars."
POLITICS_YUI_DESC:0 "An old general, Mitsue is familiar with taking on command as he'd led the Japanese Expeditionary Corps during the Russian Civil War. A honourable war hero, he has been granted the ultimate gift from the emperor; to peacefully rule over the lands he'd conquered so many years ago. The old man is an isolationist and does not seek to wage any sort of war. With him assuming power as head of Transamur, the dream of a Greater Transamur has died."

TRM_totalist_party:0 "Mladorossi"
TRM_totalist_party_long:0 "Mladorosskaya Partiya (Young Russia Party)\n§gThe history of the "Young Russian" movement is inexorably tied to its leader, the charismatic aristocrat Alexander Lvovich Kazem-Bek, born in 1902 to a wealthy noble family of Azeri and Iranian origin. The three ideological phases of the Mladorossi can be closely mapped to Kazem-Bek's own life and experience; unsurprisingly considering his role as orator and ideologist. As a student activist, Kazem-Bek helped form the "Union of Young Russia" in 1923. Uniting 29 organisations and 4,000 people, the Young Russians represented the monarchist youth wing. Prone to intellectualism and ideologically vague, its members jointly rejected reactionary Tsarism in favour of a "new and dynamic vision". As secretary, Kazem-Bek met with Professor Nikolai Ustryalov, once head of the press bureau under Admiral Kolchak. Ustryalov convinced the young aristocrat to throw his support behind the putsch against President Kerensky in 1924. Both fled to Transamur following the coup's failure, taking their respective supporters along with them. Ustryalov became disillusioned with the White movement, and began idolising the Bolsheviks as defenders of Russian sovereignty.\n\nThe formation of the "Union of Young Russians" in 1925 marked the second ideological phase of the Mladorossi. Kazem-Bek began formulating his thesis of the "Labor Monarchy" under Ustryalov's tutelage. The nascent ideology of the Mladorossi combined an absolute monarchy, Soviet democracy, Orthodox Integralism, Russian nationalism and the "revolutionary spirit". During this period of 1925-1933, most Mladorossi were united only by theatrical oath-swearing ceremonies and readership of journals such as "Vivacity!" and "Towards Young Russia". The third phase occurred shortly after Kazem-Bek's travels to the Syndicalist nations of Europe. Kazem-Bek was particularly inspired by the proto-Totalism of the French & Italian national syndicalists, as well as the British Mosleyites. On his return, Kazem-Bek formed the "Mladoross Party" in 1934 as its "Vozhd". His ideas on how to organise the Young Russian State have coalesced into a single-party corporatist model under a Worker-Monarch.\nWith a strict party structure and growing paramilitary wing, Kazem-Bek hopes to achieve control of Transamur, and then his beloved homeland, Russia.§!"

After the temporary downfall of Soviet power in Siberia, Centrosibir ceased to function in the summer of 1918. However, many delegates remained in Siberia and lay low, including the first chairman of the presidium, Boris Shumyatsky, who was granted amnesty after the end of the Civil War. Departing from orthodox Bolshevism, Centrosibir aims to separate Siberia from Russia and build a syndicalist workers' state, seeing in this the only salvation for the industrially undeveloped region."

Originally created during the Civil War to overthrow the Kolchak government as a reaction to the dire situation of peasant farms in Siberia. The situation was surprisingly brought under control, thanks to the efforts of Savinkov, who was able to convince the Supreme Leader of the need for concessions to the peasants.

Formed in 1931 by local politician and Kolchak loyalist, Anastasiy Vonsyatsky, the Natsionalisty have found support amongst Manchurian Russians and monarchist exiles. Young emigres still loyal to the ideals of a Russian Tsardom have flocked to this movement in awe of Vonsyatsky’s fiery speeches denouncing Bolshevism, Kerensky and Western Capitalism. All of which he accuses of degenerating the Russian people whilst declaring loyalty to Admiral Kolchak, the Russian Orthodox Church and a restored Tsardom. Espousing the homegrown ideology of “True Russian Nationalism”, the Natsionalisty have organised its members into a paramilitary force known as the, Black Vanguard, undoubtedly a reference to the Black Hundred.\n\n The Black Vanguard have provided security to Kolchak’s regime and have engaged in rounding up political dissidents as well as prominent members of the Jewish Vladivostok community accused of promoting ''dangerous foreign ideologies''.

### Events ###
tram.intro.t:0 "Transamur - Provisional Russian State in Vladivostok"
tram.intro.d:0 "Siberia and the Russian Far East had been a major area of conflict during the Russian Civil War, as the location of a short-lived democratic republic, the rising of the 'Czech Legion' and Japanese intervention. While forced to evacuate their forces due to German pressure (as well as intense resistance from local Cossacks), the Japanese remained eager to extend their influence and in 1922 pushed for the establishment of an independent state in the Transamur region. This motion gained the support of the Vladivostok business community, despite the fact that it left them vulnerable to forming an economic dependency on Japan. The majority of the business community however saw economic and diplomatic relations with the rising power in the East as a significant advantage, especially when compared to the alternative of being sucked further into the disorder besetting the rest of Russia. The new nation gained a prominent figurehead in the form of Admiral Kolchak, one of the most successful White Generals of the civil war and the one-time self-proclaimed 'Supreme Ruler of All Russia', who had been forced to flee Russia following his unsuccessful attempt to seize control in 1925.\n\nIn 1936, the Transamur Republic has become a corporate and militaristic state, highly tied economically to Japanese Empire. And yet Kolchak has ambitions of his own. Could he simply be playing a very dangerous game, using the Japanese protection to establish his own rule, first over Siberia, and then over Russia as a whole?"

tram.intro.b:0 "Tell me more about Transamur Politics"

tram.999.t:0 "The Oblastniki - Siberian Regionalists"
tram.999.d:0 "Siberian Regionalism is a political movement to form an autonomous Siberia. Firstly developed in the 19th century by Siberian students, it gained huge popularity during the Russian Civil War with the creation of the Provisional Government of Autonomous Siberia. However, the Provisional Siberian Government sacrificed own independence for the sake of consolidation of all possible forces to fight with Bolsheviks.\n\nDuring the rule of Kerensky, though Russia was stated as a federative republic, President has continuosly blocked all resolutions about giving wider autonomy to Siberia and it is still an undeveloped region.\n\nWhile the majority of the Siberia is under control of the Petrograd Regime, most of the Oblastniks, both leftist and rightist have support their former ally - Admiral Kolchak in the putsch as he promised wide autonomy to Siberia and he even invited a prominent Oblastnik - Pyotr Vologodsky to become a prime-minister.\n\nIn 1936 they are still waiting for Kolchak to finally unite Russia under his rule and proclaim Siberian Autonomy. Their resistance increases with their popularity and if it is high enough they can even attempt to overthrow Kolchak."

tram.998.t:0 "The Japanese Business Interests in Transamur"
tram.998.d:0 "The Japanese Empire has a huge influence on our country - they were the ones that intervened in the Far-East during the Russian Civil War and expanded their influence in the Transamur Region. In 1922 an independent nation was formed in Vladivostok, supported by local business community. However, everything changed, when in 1925 Kolchak tried to coup the Russian government and was forced to flee to Transamur, supported by Oblastniki and Transbaikal Cossacks.\n\nFinding himself in a partially-recognized state with only ally, Kolchak has nothing to do but establish even stronger economic ties with the Japanese Empire. While formally Transamur is independent, Japanese has a free military access to our territory and provide us with supplies. Our dependence on Japan varies proportionally with the popularity of the Japanese Delegation. If their influence becomes too high, they will try to establish full control over our country."

tram.997.t:0 "Vladivostok Business Community"
tram.997.d:0 "The business circles of Vladivostok-namely, the Merkulov Brothers, and other, smaller businessmen, were the basis of Transamur when this state was first proclaimed. Although in 1925 they did not become part of the Kolchak Council of Ministers, in fact, all foreign trade is based on them. Under their control, together with the Kwantung Army, is the port of Vladivostok. This situation allows the Merkulovs to get rich, the Japanese garrison to receive corrupt bribes, and Kolchak can only silently watch the rampant crime. With each visit of the Japanese delegation, the business community is becoming more and more focused on trade with Japan. And it seems that this state of affairs will remain unchanged until Kolchak decides to finally break all ties with the Japanese Empire."

tram.996.t:0 "DO-ROVS - Siberian Monarchists"
tram.996.d:0 "General Diterikhs is a convinced monarchist, whose ideas are sometimes even too radical. Disappointed in the decision of the constituent assembly to establish a Republic and not return the tsar to the throne, Diterikhs soon joined Kolchak's putsch in 1925 and ended up in Transamur with him.\n\nHere he founded the so-called 'Far Eastern Branch of the Russian All-Military Union' and settled in Nikolayevsk, where a camp of his 'Crusaders' has been created. In addition, Diterikhs also established military control over the Trans-Siberian Railway near the Rukhlovo station, where the railway connects Primorye with Transbaikalia and Yakutia.\n\nDiterikhs is still more or less loyal to the Admiral, as he hopes that the Supreme Ruler will restore the Monarchy as soon as he takes Moscow. Nobody knows why Diterikhs is so sure of this, but Kolchak should be careful, because if the DO-ROVS is not loyal to the Supreme Ruler, anything can be expected from them."

tram.995.t:0 "Ataman Semyenov and the Cossacks"
tram.995.d:0 "Ataman Semyenov is an extraordinary person. Fluent in Buryat and Mongolian, Semyenov has surrounded himself with loyal people and has his own interests in the Far Eastern region. The ataman of the Transbaikal Cossacks, Governor General of the Transbaikal Territory, the marching ataman of the Amur and Ussuri Cossacks, Semyenov is the main representative of the interests of the Cossacks in Transamur. Despite the fact that he supported Admiral Kolchak both during the civil war and during the coup, his real intentions are unknown. According to rumors, his Cossack troops are supplied with Japanese weapons.\n\nAt the moment, Semyenov is actually waging a war with the remnants of Bolshevism - the partisans of the NRA, and despite the fact that he supports the oblasts and Buryat autonomists, he is engaged in power struggle with them for power in Transbaikalia. It is not known how loyal the Cossacks are to Kolchak, but the Supreme Ruler knows one thing for sure - you can expect anything from them."

tram.994.t:0 "NRA and Political Centre"
tram.994.d:0 "When much of eastern Siberia came under the rule of the Cossacks and the loyalists of the Admiral-Dictator in 1925, there were those who did not end up here in exile. The Siberian Social Revolutionaries, who held power in the region and were legitimately elected, found themselves at a crossroads - either to flee their native regions to Russia, which was undergoing a severe political crisis at the dawn of Kerensky's presidency, or to stay here - and take up arms.\n\nIn order to resist the military dictatorship and the lawlessness of the Cossacks, the leader of the Siberian Social Revolutionaries, Evgeny Kolosov, established the Political Center, an association of the last real revolutionary democrats of the Far East. He was supported by Nikolai Kalashnikov, a prominent officer and Brigadier of the 53rd Siberian Rifle Regiment. The rebels soon became the People's Revolutionary Army - extremely small, but quite effective guerilla force, periodically arranging raids on the Trans-Siberian Railway. Soon the so-called New Bolsheviks - Boris Shumyatsky, the former leader of Siberian Soviet, Pyetr Nikiforov and even the Militant Godless - also joined the struggle and became associated with the NRA.\n\nHowever, the revolt failed. Trying to raise an uprising against the Siberian army, Kalashnikov deserted and hid in the Siberian taiga. Surprisingly, somehow the partisan movement in Transbaikalia was able to survive to this day. Perhaps the slave-like living conditions of the workers in Chita and Khabarovsk and the return of the landlord system in the agricultural areas contributed to this, but now the NRA is a patchwork of partisans, scattered all over Transbaikalia, agitating for a return to socialism and probably sponsored all along by the Kerensky regime. Leading an underground struggle and organizing sabotage, this movement must be destroyed."

tram.51.t:0 "Union of Musketeers of His Highness Prince Nikita Alexandrovich"
tram.51.d:0 "\"The Union of Musketeers\" was founded in 1924 in Harbin by Prince Vladimir Innokentyevich Gantimurov. Gantimurov, a native of Transbaikalia and belonging to the family of Tungus princes, served under General Molchanov in 1920 at the dawn of the Civil War. Gantimurov, the son of a border guard officer, was in Harbin at an early age. And in 1924 he was only 18 years old. His \"Union of Musketeers\", Vladimir Gantimurov, a romanticist and dreamer, decided to create after watching the film \"The Three Musketeers\". The first motto of the organization - \"One for All, and All for One\" - was also taken from the film about the Three Musketeers. Members of the Union of Musketeers came up with a distinctive uniform: black flared pants, worn loose, and black shirts \"Apache\" with laces on the collar and cuffs. The costume was complemented by black belts with tassels around the waist and a black cap. Subsequently, each branch was given a certain color and used on the uniforms the armbands of the corresponding color\n\nInitially, the organization did not pursue any political goals in its creation. The task was simple - to beat the children of Harbin Bolsheviks, who found themselves in Red Harbin after the defeat of the Reds in the Far East.  In search of ideological support, the leadership of the Union of Musketeers appealed to Grand Duke Nikita Romanov with a proposal to take patronage of the Union. After his positive response, on December 20, 1929, the name of the organization was changed and it was called henceforth \"Union of Musketeers of His Highness Prince Nikita Alexandrovich\". The Union also got political goals, the main of which were the overthrow of the Socialist Revolutionary regime in Russia and restoration of the monarchy. In 1931-1932, non-commissioned officer courses were opened by the Union together with the Russian All-Russian Military Union, and Gantimurov soon found himself in Nikolaevsk, where he joined the ranks of the DO-ROVS."

Despite the fact that the patron of the organization, Nikita, was not particularly interested in the affairs of the Musketeers all this time, he saw before him well disciplined and organized fighters, who had long ago gone beyond the scope of children's games.\n\nThe leader of the Musketeers, Prince Gantimurov, appealed to the Sovereign Tsar to take into account the merits of the Musketeers and grant him a place in the Council of Ministers, as an adviser to His Majesty.\n\nAlthough Nikita Alekseyevich understood that it was better to surround himself with definitely loyal subjects, perhaps, in the situation in which he found himself, it was better to rely on the more experienced fighters of the ROVS who had actually gone through the war."

Kamynin, an all-social cooperative society "Economia" was organized, which became one of the largest cooperatives in Siberia and Transbaikalia.\n\nAt the end of 1916 the cooperative opened a bakery, and later purchased a coarse-grain mill, a leather and chrome factory, a soap factory, a sawmill, a lumberyard in the village of Ganzurino, a fish cannery in Posolskoe, a dairy farm and a hog farm in Verkhneudinsk. In 1916 the cooperative opened its own sausage production in order to "improve the quality and price". Cooperative sausage was on sale in February 1917, which immediately reduced the price in private shops by 20 kopecks per pound, and soon private producers were also forced to improve their quality following the cooperative.\n\nHowever, already at the end of 1918 an underground NRA committee was established in Verkhneudinsk. And since then, it is believed that it was thanks to it that the NRA coordinated its subversive actions in the Transbaikalia. It cannot go on like this, and either this cooperative must be disbanded or it must be reorganized into a consumer society and placed under direct state control."

Although these supplies were useful, they made Tranamur more and more dependent on Japan.

The generals say that the NRA is a red underdog and must be treated accordingly, and finally to finish off this last splinter of Red October. On the other hand, there are voices saying that the NRA consists of not only Bolsheviks but also Socialist-Revolutionaries and, taking into consideration Pepelyaev's own views, he could find a common language with that part of the NRA and smash the rest of the Bolsheviks.

Others say that the monarchists are the main breeding ground of reaction and, playing on Pepelyaev's feelings, argue that they are in favor of restoring the old serf landlord system, and therefore we should not cooperate with them, but suppress them by all the means we can.

Therefore, we must nationalize it, or our government will come to an end.\n\n- This argument gets us nowhere, so I propose a compromise, so as not to turn away all the big industrialists, then let's nationalize only the military industry?

Since many of them have bonds with us, they prefer to use the more or less stable Transamurian Ruble instead of the fluctuating Fengtian Tael, though its unclear if the transactions with our currency are legal or not.

The sacredness of the crowning ceremony permeated him, and it seemed that God was really giving him power - noble power.\n\nAccepting the crown from the bishop, the emperor laid it on himself. It was not a real crown, kept in the Kremlin, but it was a powerful symbol of royal power.\n\nMeletius continued with the ceremony. \"Pious most autocratic Great Sovereign Emperor of All Russia!

After some time, the second Constituent Assembly was convened, and Kolchak resigned from his position as the Supreme Ruler of Russia.\n\nBut the next 5 years changed everything. First, the ongoing Japanese occupation of Transamur, in which local businesses seized power, effectively turning Vladivostok into a Japanese colony. Secondly, the German \"occupation\" of Russian industry, approved by Kerensky in the name of economic prosperity. Third, the rampant left-wing forces, famine in the Volga region, indulgences for the peasants, alienation of the property of the rich.\n\nAll this led to the event known as the Kolchak Putsch of 1925. And now the admiral has once again taken on the furrows of the Supreme Ruler, leading the Russian State in exile, waiting for the chance to return to Moscow and finally restore order in Russia."

Everything changed in 1925, when the territory of Transamur radically increased, and in Vladivostok, in addition to them and the Japanese, the Siberian Army of Kolchak, the DO-ROVS, the Cossacks and the Siberian Regionalists appeared. Vladivostok, thus being the capital of Transamur, became a chessboard for all political groups of Transamur. And maybe Kolchak thinks that he is in charge here, but this is a mistake.\n\nAt the head of Vladivostok is the Japanese garrison of the Kwantung army, which guards the port of Vladivostok, and without its permission, no goods enter Vladivostok. But permission is very easy to get, especially if you belong to the Merkulov family - the richest entrepreneurs in the Far East. With a pocket Japanese garrison, the Merkulov brothers are trying not only to subdue the entire Vladivostok trade, but also politics with Spiridon Merkulov's National-Democratic Union being one of the largest allowed political parties in the Far-East."

The main and most reasonable suspicions arose, of course, from Prime Minister Vologodsky, despite his long acquaintance and the position of prime minister in the very first Kolchak government during the civil war.\n\nKolchak does not have many options for forming a new government, but one of the key decisions is to remove regional officials from the government and replace them with either more loyal military or Cossacks, or, conversely, to form a government of 'people's trust'."

After a silly strike on the base, the defenders fired from fortified positions and towers littered with sandbags, fighting off NRA forces like fish in a barrel. Finally, after suffering significant losses, the IRA again fled, but not immediately, leaving their wounded and fallen comrades behind.

But in essence, it doesn't change anything).\nSo what are these principles? It is difficult to give an exhaustive description in a short article. But it is possible to outline the general features. Let us summarize them in seven statements.\n1) Freedom of conscience and cults.\n2) Freedom of speech, of thought, of the press, and of scientific creativity. \n3) Political freedom - for all, and especially for the opposition.  Where there is no opposition, there is no democracy. The presence or absence of opposition is one of the most striking criteria. It is absurd to say that democracy gives freedom only to supporters of the ruling majority (and sometimes they add the ruling minority). Any government gives its supporters freedom and encouragement, and a special one - undemocratic. The question of the limits of permissible opposition (in democracies) is decided in reality, i.e., by the psychology of society, its cultural and legal concepts.\n4) Representative institutions are effective and real, not formal and fictitious.\n5) Free elections.\n6) A responsible ministry. \n7) Independent courts.\nAnd again, - responsible government, independent courts - all this is difficult to define formally, but it is absolutely real to "feel", to "experience"."

trammlad.5.t: "Healthy National Consciousness"
trammlad.5.d: "The most reliable guarantee and at the same time an absolutely necessary condition of correct and durable solution of all questions of state life, under any circumstances, is a healthy national consciousness, inherent, if not in the whole nation, at least in its leading stratum. But a healthy national consciousness depends, first of all, on the degree of rootedness in it of some prerequisites, representing, as it were, the foundation of the state existence of a nation. The firmness of these prerequisites in the national consciousness is the first condition for the viability of the state. Therefore, everything that contradicts them, that creates precedents that undermine their firmness in the perception of people, that serves to weaken their clearness in the national consciousness - all this should be rejected without any hesitation, and no circumstances, no considerations, no aims can justify it. For it is absurd, for the sake of salvation of the state, to undermine its most basic viability, to attack the very sources of its existence. Likewise, it is absurd, for the sake of the struggle for one's faith, to violate, distort, and discard its most basic requirements and precepts.\nIt seems to us that the most basic, most necessary prerequisite, without the presence of which in the national consciousness is simply unthinkable the very existence of a great and viable state, is faith in the fatherland itself. This belief consists of two elements: firstly, the belief that the independent existence, development and greatness of the Fatherland is a value of the highest order, and secondly, the belief in the spiritual and physical strength of the nation, that it is worthy of the great historical lot and is able to cope in its own strength with the historical mission which has fallen to its lot. Note, by the way, that the faith of the Russian nation in its own eyes, in the eyes of all its constituent parts, all the tribes and nationalities that make it up, serves, in particular, as the main factor serving the existence of Russia as a unified state. It is the fall of this prestige that underlies all the separatist currents, all the centrifugal forces of our time.\nAs every living organism, every healthy and viable nation has a natural instinct for self-preservation. And so, in a nation that has achieved in its cultural development a state existence, this instinct is inseparable, say, merges with faith in one's fatherland. It generates this faith, but is also generated and strengthened by it. Moreover, it is reborn by it from an ordinary instinct belonging only to the subconscious, to a conscious and reasonable aspiration. For only faith can push into this instinct a healthy meaning and give it a reasonable justification and justification in the eyes of people. But in a healthy nation living a state life, the instinct of self-preservation finds concrete expression, first of all, in the fact that all aspirations of this nation are subordinated to the desire to preserve and ensure the independence and security of its country, in its entirety. Practically, the predominance of this aspiration over all others is expressed in unswerving fidelity, conscious or unconscious, to the principles demanding of us: 1) to guard at all costs and in preference to all other matters the sovereignty of our fatherland, 2) to protect the integrity of its territory and 3) to uphold, under all circumstances, its prestige, both outside and inside. \nOutside these principles, there can be no faith in the fatherland, no national pride, no true national consciousness at all."

Eurasians argue that Russia is neither Europe nor Asia, but something third: Eurasia. Saying that Russian statehood originates not only from Kievan Rus, but also from the Golden Horde, they preach a unique way of Russia, which belongs neither to Europe nor to Asia. And so we turn to them for support of our movement. But the Eurasian Party is a party of many people, so we have to decide with whom we should try to establish links. On the one hand, the most obvious option is to try to connect with Trubetskoy, because he is the head of the party, and if he supports us, then the whole Eurasian Party with him. But there is one thing - we have too few points of contact with him, so such an alliance is unlikely to last long. On the other hand, there is a small number of so-called left-wing Eurasians in the party, led by Dmitry Svyatopolk-Mirsky and Roman Jakobson, which are closer to our social views, but anti-monarchist.

trammlad.11.d: "Life teaches us that the eternal ideals of people, be it the ideal of a tribe, a nation or a people, find their brightest expression at one-man rule, and exactly in that case, when the leadership belongs to a person, indicated by a rooted custom from time immemorial, - as if by nature itself, prepared for it. And such a person, not in the measure of his personal merits, but precisely because of his high purpose, is more capable than others of comprehending the common ideals and of selfless service to them. Thus, the care for the children of their parents is, in general, more meaningful and effective than the work of strangers, even if very good. Children may not think of their parents as human beings, the very best - that would be naive. But children feel, and in general they are right, that their parents, precisely in relation to them, their children, are better than other people. These kinds of considerations apply to every kind of historically established one-man rule. The monarchical power is, in fact, based on the signs of the expediency of such one-man rule. By its meaning and the character of its origin, monarchic power is possible only in conditions of an organic dormitory of people, in other words, in such a dormitory, which as a result of its long existence has found unity and, in that very field of its life, where it came to undivided authority and worked out a leader for itself. And since the monarchical power is based on universal unity, its expediency is aggravated by the indisputable fact that wherever the goals and the means of achieving them are clear, the one-man rule is always the most effective and fruitful. At least by virtue of such a purely practical consideration, the ideal of conciliar life requires monarchy. But if the power of the monarch, completing the unity of the nation, is, above all, the expression and stronghold of its ideals, it is clear that in his actions the monarch is not free, but subordinated to them, to these ideals."
trammlad.11.a: "Long live the Tsar!"

trammlad.12.t: "Russia's Ascendency..."
trammlad.12.d: "This circumstance, which distinguishes his power from the absolute power, which does not know any barriers and rules solely by its own understanding and will, is the most essential feature of the Russian understanding of monarchy, of that monarchy which has been called autocratic in our country from time immemorial. In this state of affairs, the monarch appears as if he were the executor, not of the will of his contemporaries, but of the collective will of the nation as a whole. Therefore his power cannot be called executive in the usual sense of the word. However, for the monarch to carry the burden of power successfully, he must have a close connection with the nation as a whole, with its past, present, and future. After all, the essence of monarchical power is, in fact, the complete unity of the nation with its leader. This unity is also required by the Russian national ideals, which the monarch serves. Thus, according to the Russian understanding of monarchy, the tsar must be Orthodox. The Orthodox understanding of ecclesiality requires the participation of all believers in revealing the will of God. The Orthodox Church, then, is a conciliar church. And a universal understanding of God's will creates especially favorable conditions for an autocratic monarchy. True autocracy, in its purely Russian sense, contrary to the despotic absolutism of Western monarchies, is possible only under Orthodoxy. According to the Russian understanding of monarchy, the tsar can be only one who has been determined to do so by the church order, - who has been determined to do so by fate, but not by men. The tsar, like the father, must be "natural. The centuries-old common life of the nation and of the dynasty that heads it contributes to their spiritual unity and makes that the ideals of the nation, in the creation and development of which the dynasty participates not only indisputably, but also enormously, receive their most vivid expression, precisely, in the dynasty - become its patrimonial patrimony. And it is through the dynasty that the monarch finds himself linked to the entire past of his nation.\nTime relates a nation to its dynasty, - time fills their life together with mutual understanding and trust, mutual love and a sense of responsibility for each other. Time destroys the monarch's dependence on the people, on their will, and thus puts him in the conditions most conducive to his impartiality and therefore to justice. But even more than independence from the will of his subjects, the monarch needs constant and lively communication with them. For communication is the source of all unity. Where there is no communication, there is no unity, and where there is no unity, there is no monarchy. The communication of the monarch with his subjects unites them spiritually, and every single moment not only protects what has been created - their spiritual unity - but also continues to create this unity, nourishes it, extending it to everything new, which the ever-changing life puts forward."
trammlad.12.a: "Long live the Tsar!"

trammlad.13.t: "Russia's Ascendency..."
trammlad.13.d: "The feeling and consciousness of this calamity will inevitably spread among the subjects, for each of them, in one way or another, is the holder of national ideals... But Russian history knows almost no such moments. Since the monarch combines an understanding of national ideals and loyalty to them with impartiality and justice, since the voluntary submission of his contemporaries is both natural and beneficial, because it makes it possible to implement what the nation needs most - its spiritual unity. But the monarch does not see violence as the way to establishing unity.\nHe must allow everyone to participate freely in the search for truth, and only in cases of irreconcilable disagreement must he point to the opinion he considers, to whomever it may belong, the most correct. And universal agreement with the monarch's direction will be erected on a universal desire for truth and unity, either on the consciousness of the justice of the monastic judgment, or on humility before the idea that unity is necessary, that only by such agreement can it be saved, that there is no other way to unity, and indeed there cannot be. In view of the fact that the general and, so to speak, supra-temporary interests of the nation are above the local and temporary interests of its various parts, the voice of the monarch must be central to the political life of the nation, in other words, the supreme power must belong to the monarch. If we consider that the monarch defends before his contemporaries the interests of the nation as a whole, - the interests of its past, present and future, and if we extend the idea of formal democracy to the totality of all the members of the nation - dead, living and not yet born - it becomes clear that the monarch stands in the majority and that he, alone, must have the upper hand over all his contemporaries, taken together. Such a consideration, however, being based on the recognition of the superiority of the majority over the minority, not of truth over error, is not consistent with the spirit of cathedral life and does not seem worthy of consideration. The universal and free search for truth, with the monarch acting as supreme judge in the struggle of various feelings and opinions, is the only way to the spiritual unity of the nation. That said, the function of the monarch is what they now like to call arbitration. The monarch, it is the supreme arbiter. But arbitration does not exhaust the significance that the monarch has in the conciliar life of the nation.\nHis participation in the discussion of questions that threaten universal unity ennobles the council's activity, imparting to it the spirit of the search for truth and justice, in other words, giving it that moral direction which alone can lead men to unity. Arbitration is a matter of supreme authority. The supreme authority is subject only to the ideals it is called upon to serve. In this sense an autocratic monarch is not bound by the will of his subjects. But he is bound to lead them on the path of spiritual unity, to listen to their opinions and to decide by conscience where truth lies. And we know that the supreme power's rejection of this\nThus, the autocratic monarchy not only relies on the spiritual unity of the nation, but also creates it. The growth of national unity and the education and creative life of an autocratic monarchy are inseparable processes, each depending on the other, and each conditioning the other."

trammlad.147.t:0 "The Union of Mladorossi"
trammlad.147.d:0 "The history of the "Young Russian" movement is inexorably tied to its leader, the charismatic aristocrat Alexander Lvovich Kazem-Bek, born in 1902 to a wealthy noble family of Azeri and Iranian origin. The three ideological phases of the Mladorossi can be closely mapped to Kazem-Bek's own life and experience; unsurprisingly considering his role as orator and ideologist. As a student activist, Kazem-Bek helped form the "Union of Young Russia" in 1923. Uniting 29 organisations and 4,000 people, the Young Russians represented the monarchist youth wing. Prone to intellectualism and ideologically vague, its members jointly rejected reactionary Tsarism in favour of a "new and dynamic vision". As secretary, Kazem-Bek met with Professor Nikolai Ustryalov, once head of the press bureau under Admiral Kolchak. Ustryalov convinced the young aristocrat to throw his support behind the putsch against President Kerensky in 1924. Both fled to Transamur following the coup's failure, taking their respective supporters along with them. Ustryalov became disillusioned with the White movement, and began idolising the Bolsheviks as defenders of Russian sovereignty.\n\nThe formation of the "Union of Young Russians" in 1925 marked the second ideological phase of the Mladorossi. Kazem-Bek began formulating his thesis of the "Labor Monarchy" under Ustryalov's tutelage. The nascent ideology of the Mladorossi combined an absolute monarchy, Soviet democracy, Orthodox Integralism, Russian nationalism and the "revolutionary spirit". During this period of 1925-1933, most Mladorossi were united only by theatrical oath-swearing ceremonies and readership of journals such as "Vivacity!" and "Towards Young Russia". The third phase occurred shortly after Kazem-Bek's travels to the Syndicalist nations of Europe. Kazem-Bek was particularly inspired by the proto-Totalism of the French & Italian national syndicalists, as well as the British Mosleyites. On his return, Kazem-Bek formed the "Mladoross Party" in 1934 as its "Vozhd". His ideas on how to organise the Young Russian State have coalesced into a single-party corporatist model under a Worker-Monarch.\n\nWith a strict party structure and growing paramilitary wing, Kazem-Bek hopes to achieve control of Transamur, and then his beloved homeland, Russia."

Young emigres still loyal to the ideals of a Russian Tsardom have flocked to this movement in awe of Vonsyatsky’s fiery speeches denouncing Bolshevism, Kerensky and Western Capitalism.

Espousing the homegrown ideology of “True Russian Nationalism”, the Natsionalisty have organised its members into a paramilitary force known as the, Black Vanguard, undoubtedly a reference to the Black Hundred.\n\n The Black Vanguard have provided security to Kolchak’s regime and have engaged in rounding up political dissidents as well as prominent members of the Jewish Vladivostok community accused of promoting ''dangerous foreign ideologies''. Admiral Kolchak has allowed for these actions to take place without officially endorsing the movements, perhaps to appease the Japanese authorities wary of an anti-foreign movement."

But, Kazem-Bek still holds out hope that a Romanov Claimant will approach us and let us crown him Tsar. However, one positive is that Kazem-Bek’s position has never been stronger, as there is no Tsar that reigns technically above him; even though the Tsar would hold little real power.

Our Vozhd has taken this so far that he even wears a small turtle pin on his lapel and brings a few of these painted propaganda turtles along with him wherever he goes to spread the message and notoriety of our new creed.

The Russian nation has risen. But it's damp and cold in the shadow of the Turtle.

These rallies and speeches acted as a gas canister being poured onto wooden logs before a fire, with uniformed members of the Natsionalisty organizing marches through Japanese settlements and drawing the rising sun on Japanese owned businesses, identifying to the entire city who it was owned by. \n\nThis was the beginning of course, with the gasoline only needing a spark to be lit, and today that spark has been provided. The distant horizon held a shadow play of flames and smoke coming from the burning Japanese homes, where their businesses were set aflame by Natsionalisty crowds and people out in the street at the time were beaten savagely. The night proved to be long and terrifying to those sheltering down in their homes, hoping fire would not be lit to them. At long last however, the crowds dispersed and the military appeared, initially thought to be restoring order, but they ended up proving to be a bitter end to the Japanese community that greeted them when they ordered them to mount trucks.

Verkhneudinsk, bordering Irkutsk region of Russia is in a state of constant war preparations and increased border security, maintained by the joint forces of Kolchak and Cossacks. At the same time, the region has a local civilian government of Oblastniki and Buryats, who view Verkhneudinsk as their native and rightful home.\nMoreover, the region is filled with NRA partisans who try to provoke and sabotage either of the present political groups.§!"
TRM_Chita_TITLE:0 "§LChita is a large transport hub, which brings together a lot of Far-Eastern workers and, therefore, NRA partisans. What is more, local Chita Oblastniki are also a powerful force in the region, who are engaged in the power struggle with the local Master of Chita...\nThe region is under an undisputed control of Ataman Semyenov, who constantly terrorizes NRA and Oblastniki and builds a strong Cossack Host.

TRM_Khabarovsk_TITLE:0 "§LThe Region of Khabarovsk was one of the main battlefields during the Civil War. Right now the Ussuri Cossack Host is located here, though its power is very limited due to the fact, that Khabarovsk is located in the so-called 'core Transamur'. The private sector and industry in the city is monopolized by Vladivostok Business Circles, which helps the NRA to bolster socialist sentiments in the region.

TRM_Magadan_TITLE:0 "§LThe City of Okhotsk was once the main base the main base on the eastern borders of Russia for the flotilla and ships of the Russian-American Company and later became the cradle of the Pacific Fleet. However, the glorious times have passed and now Okhotsk is nothing more than another 'godforsaken place' in the middle of Siberian nowhere. Despite Okhotsk desolation, the Pacific Fleet is still there and is still loyal to the Supreme Ruler and Admiral, making it a cherry on the cake for the Japanese Empire.§!"
TRM_Nikolayevsk_TITLE:0 "§LDespite the fact that Nikolaevsk is a fairly small city located at the mouth of the Amur River, it is the center of gold mining in the entire Russian Far East and the second most important Far Eastern port.\nThough initially under the Japanese Intervention protection, right now the city of Nikolayevsk and the entire region is the main strongold of the DO-ROVS.

TRM_Vladivostok_TITLE:0 "§LAh, Vladivostok, the Pacific gate of Russia!\nThe capital city of the Far East is perhaps the only place in the country where its fate is decided. With the Port of Vladivostok under occupation of the Japanese forces and Vladivostok Business Circle, the administrative buildings under 'occupation' of Kolchak Government, the military bases under control of the DO-ROVS, only streets and factories are left, where people are talking only about freedom and equality, inspired by the local Oblastniki and underground NRA resistance.§!"
TRM_Primorye_TITLE:0 "§LPrimorye, despite being close to the capital city is much less developed, with the Kolchak loyalist forces spread across the region, trying to restore order. The influence of the Japanese and Vladivostok Business is as high here, as in the city of Vladivostok.§!"
TRM_Sakhalin_TITLE:0 "§LThe island of Sakhalin was under full Japanese occupation since 1920, making 'Karafuto' one of the bastions of the Japanese forces. The Sakhalin region is not only rich in fish, forest and coal, but also in something, very precious - Oil. As long as Sakhalin is ours, we can be sure that we have cheap fuel for the Pacific Fleet§!"
TRM_Yakutia_TITLE:0 "§LYakutia, the land of native Yakuts has a long and complex story of relations with Kolchak government. When in November 1918 Yakutia was captured by Kolchak's troops, the local Yakuts never received the autonomy they wanted and anti-Kolchak rebellion succeeded in December 1919. However, the Civil War soon came to an end, bringing back the civilian republican government, which still did nothing with desired Yakut Autonomy. Everything changed in 1925 when Oblastniki seized the initiative and joined the Far-Eastern Republic, establishing Yakut Autonomous Republic. Though Yakutia still stays anti-Kolchak, they will not tolerate his suzerainty over their territory.§!"

With the annexation of Transbaikalia to Transamur, the activities of the local Buryat-Mongolian self-government were suspended, but power in the region was still concentrated in the hands of civilian Siberian regionalists.\n\nIn addition to the Buryat Mongols and local regionalists, the lands of the Transbaikal Cossack army of Semenov are located in Transbaikalia and the NRA partisans are most concentrated.
