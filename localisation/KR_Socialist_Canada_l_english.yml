CAN_Canada_Liberated:0 "Canada Liberated!"
CAN_Canada_Liberated_desc:0 "At long last the forces of Exile and Reaction have been banished from our fair shore. Free from the Mad King's tyranny, Canada can finally flourish under a Government by Canadians - for Canadians. Just like in 1925, the King's subjects have thrown off their chains, banishing the forces of reaction to foreign shores. One can only wonder how long it will be until their subjects revolt against them as well."
CAN_Congress_of_Canadian_Socialists:0 "Hold the Congress of Canadian Socialists"
CAN_Congress_of_Canadian_Socialists_desc:0 "Now that the many Socialist groups of Canada are no longer confined to the shadows, a congress of Socialist groups in Canada has been organized to elect a new Government. While the incumbent [Root.GetRulingParty] Bloc has a strong lead, any number of groups could find themselves in the lead by the Congress' end."

CAN_Burn_the_Royal_Portraits:0 "Burn the Royal Portraits!"
CAN_Burn_the_Royal_Portraits_desc:0 "The time has come to banish the vestiges of Monarchism from Canada. The remnants of Royalist Tyranny shall be burned in the streets - while the King's insignia shall be broken off public buildings with crowbars. A Republican Tide has washed over Canada, and when it has receded not a single symbol of the King's reign shall remain. "
CAN_Fate_of_the_RCMP:0 "Fate of the RCMP"
CAN_Fate_of_the_RCMP_desc:0 "The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, or the 'Mounties' as they were better known, were at one point the King's most rabid attack dogs against the forces of Socialist Liberation. With the Royalists banished, the question of the Mounties has once more come up. Shall we do away with this symbol of the Old Order, or shall we restore the RCMP on our terms?"
CAN_Smash_the_Establishment:0 "Shatter the Establishment"
CAN_Smash_the_Establishment_desc:0 "The remains of Canada's Old Order still lurks in the shadows, plotting the destruction of the Socialist Paradise we've built. To keep the forces of Reaction from returning once more, drastic action must be taken."
CAN_Eradicate_the_Imperialists:0 "Eradicate the Imperialists"
CAN_Eradicate_the_Imperialists_desc:0 "Despite all their failures, supporters of Arcand's ill-fated 'Imperial Unity Party' still roam the countryside. Concentrated in Northern Ontario, these terrorists have led an underground resistance against our young Socialist Government, and have been launching sporadic attacks on Supply Depots and Military Bases ever since they popped up. Dubbed 'Rotha's Raiders' due to the leadership of one Rotha Lintorn-Orman, these Reactionaries pose a mortal threat to the Socialist Order. They must be eliminated."

CAN_Rebuild_Canada:0 "Rebuild Canada"
CAN_Rebuild_Canada_desc:0 "Our war against the Royalists left a great many dead and a great deal of our great nation with grievous damage. The first step towards building a Socialist Paradise in Canada rebuilding the great nation we all call home."
CAN_Distribute_Exile_Wealth:0 "Distribute Exile Wealth"
CAN_Distribute_Exile_Wealth_desc:0 "The concentration of Wealth and Industry around the affluent British Exile community has finally come to an end. With it, the time has come to return these ill-gotten gains to the people of Canada. [CANGetExilePolicy]" 
CAN_intern_exiles:0 "The resourceful and well-connected Exiles have fled Canada's shores, while those who have either chosen to remain or have been captured by Revolutionary Guards now pay their debts to society. Ironically, the Exiles now toil in camps that bear a strong resemblance to the 'Unemployment Camps' used to herd destitute Canadians during the Great Depression."
CAN_expel_exiles:0 "Now that the remaining Exiles have fled, Canadian Citizens can finally breathe free without languishing under the tyranny of wandering Aristocrats. While our nation is reeling from the loss of manpower, it is worth it to be truly free from our British 'Guests'."
CAN_expel_wealthy_exiles:0 "Now that the wealthiest Exiles have fled, Canadian Citizens and the can finally breathe free without languishing under the tyranny of wandering Aristocrats. Additionally, the truly displaced Exiles can reap the benefits of a truly free society."
CAN_seize_exile_wealth:0 "The Exiles, despite inflicting immeasurable damage to Canada, are still humans, and must be treated accordingly. While their wealth has been seized by the state, these Émigrées have been allowed to continue living their lives in Canada. Free from the burdens of Kings and Reclamation, they are no longer 'Exiles' - rather they are Canadian Citizens just like the rest."
CAN_exile_default:0 "Now that the Exiles have been stripped of their political influence, it is up to the Government to decide the final fate of Canada's Exile community"
CAN_Agricultural_Revolution:0 "Canada's Agricultural Revolution"
CAN_Agricultural_Revolution_desc:0 "The heartland of Canada's newfound Revolution was in the Prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Far from the intellectual centers of Syndicalist thought in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, these rural areas provide a vital backbone for Canada's socialist transformation. Piggybacking on the work done by the CCF, [CAN.GetLeader] and the [GetRulingParty] shall forge a true Agrarian Arcadia in the nation we call home."
CAN_New_Economy:0 "A New, Red Economy"
CAN_New_Economy_desc:0 "[CANGetEconomicPolicy]"
CAN_vanguardist_economy_desc:0 "Yielding to the vision of the CPC/MEL/CUM bloc, Canada's economy will be reorganized on radical lines. The creation of a Command Economy will allow the Government to exert much-needed control over the production and allocation of essential goods. This path forward will ensure that the keys to Canada's economy will be kept out of the hands of Capitalists and Social-Reactionaries."
CAN_unionized_economy_desc:0 "Following the line of Canada's many Syndicalist groups, Canada's economy will be reorganized under Trade Union Guidance. The days of workers toiling in squalor and working for unfair pay is over, as all working Canadians will now fall under the umbrella of a Trade Union. Workplaces that refuse Collective Bargaining agreements or attempt to gatekeep Workers from Union Representation will be shut down or placed under new management."
CAN_collective_economy_desc:0 "Under the influence of the Socialist SPC/SDP/CPC bloc, the CCS has started the creation of a Publicly Owned Economy. In this system, large assets and enterprises will be owned and operated by the Masses themselves. This program of society-wide ownership will ensure that Canada's industry and natural resources will work for the people, not against them."
CAN_publicly_owned_economy_desc:0 "Following the CCF's example, the CCS has agreed on a program of Publicly-Owned economics. Private enterprises shall still be allowed to exist under the Government's watch, while larger industries and natural resources shall fall under the government's jurisdiction. As well, essential utilities, such as Electrical, Hyrdo and Transportation infrastructure shall be kept out of the hands of Private Business."
CAN_eco_default:0 "With Canada's Socialist transformation complete, the time has come for the CCS to decide on a new course for our Nation's economy. Each faction of the CCS has their own unique approach, but only time will tell which one will get the chance to implement their vision." 

CAN_Triumph_of_the_FPU:0 "Victory of the FPU"
CAN_Triumph_of_the_FPU_desc:0 "In an incredible upset, the Newfoundland centric Fishermen's Protective Union has claimed victory in the first session of the CCS. This East-Coast Union's claim to fame has propelled them to victory on the national level, allowing them to implement their Maritime-centric policies across both Canada and Newfoundland."
CAN_Expand_to_the_Pacific:0 "Pacific Expansion"
CAN_Expand_to_the_Pacific_desc:0 "A mari usque ad mare - From Sea to Sea. Canada as a nation now extends from St. Johns to Vancouver, and contains coastlines on both the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean. With these vast seas come countless Fishermen struggling to make a living. With the FPU in power, these Fishermen can be represented by a government which truly understands their plight."
CAN_Alliance_With_Sector_Unions:0 "Trade Union Alliances"
CAN_Alliance_With_Sector_Unions_desc:0 "The FPU, while mighty, only represents a very small sector of the Canadian workforce. To keep their hold on power, the FPU has moved to allign various Trade Unions across Canada. From the Trades and Labour Congress, to the French-Canadian Confédération des Syndicats Nationaux, to other profession-specific Guilds such as the United Auto Workers, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the International Longshoremen's Association."
CAN_Venerate_Coaker:0 "Veneration of William Coaker"
CAN_Venerate_Coaker_desc:0 "At first the figures recognized as Canada's founders were bloodthirsty Imperialists such as John A. MacDonald. Today, the founder of Modern Canada is undeniably personified in Sir William Coaker: founder of the FPU and the man who led Canada to victory against the forces of reaction. The FPU shall give credit to their founder, and elevate Coaker to his rightful place among Canada's Fathers of Confederation."

CAN_Canadian_Union_of_Maximists:0 "The Canadian Union of Maximists"
CAN_Canadian_Union_of_Maximists_desc:0 "Perhaps the only major organization in Canada which advocates for Charter Totalism, the Canadian Union of Maximists or CUM has claimed victory in the first session of the CCS. Despite their veneration of Mosley and advocating for a Charterist approach, the CUM is remarkably moderate in comparison to their Totalist counterparts across the world."
CAN_Studying_Mosleys_Axioms:0 "Following Mosley's Axioms"
CAN_Studying_Mosleys_Axioms_desc:0 "Oswald Mosley is perhaps the most influential person in the creation of the Totalist ideology. Drawing heavily from Mosley, the CUM has moved to enshrine Maximist policy into Canadian Law, and invite Mosley himself to oversee the process. While Mosley is undeniably suspicious of our group's 'Moderate' stances, Mosley is not one to snub an attempt to spread his ideology."
CAN_Alliance_With_Aboriginal_Groups:0 "Alliance with Aboriginal Groups"
CAN_Alliance_With_Aboriginal_Groups_desc:0 "Canada's many Native peoples have long been abused at the hands of the Royal Government, and have disgustingly been looked over by even mainline Socialist groups. Crate has long been a fighter for Native rights, famously securing equal pay for Native Indian workers in the mines while he was a Union Organizer. Now in power, Chairman Crate has sought to make amends, and has officially moved to bar discriminatory action by our government towards our nation's Native Peoples."
CAN_Canadas_Moderate_Maximists_Miracle:0 "Canada's Moderate Maximist Miracle"
CAN_Canadas_Moderate_Maximists_Miracle_desc:0 "'Totalist' is perhaps the dirtiest word in modern politics. The vile label hurled at even the most moderate of Socialists, often by other Socialists themselves. However in Canada the word 'Totalist' conjures a much different meaning. Far removed from the images of repression and black-booted thugs dragging honest people into the night, Canada's Maximist Revolution has been executed with the trademark Canadian friendliness. While there is always discontent lurking in the shadows, Canada today has prospered under the guidance and vigilance of Chairman Chuck Crate, who has ensured that the words of the Totalist Charter will contribute to a freer and more equal Canada."

CAN_Marxian_Education_League:0 "Victory of the Lovestoneites"
CAN_Marxian_Education_League_desc:0 "Followers of American Socialist Jay Lovestone have come up on top in the first congress of the CCS. Influenced by his strange 'Market-Socialist' and Internationalist ideals, supporters of the 'Marxian Educational League' seek to radically reshape Canada's political and cultural climate. Whether their grandiose plans will bear fruit is anybody's guess."
CAN_Lovestoneism:0 "Following in Lovestone's Footsteps"
CAN_Lovestoneism_desc:0 "As the most prolific inspiration for Moriarty's movement, Jay Lovestone's expertise and input will do wonders in reshaping Canada from a frosty refuge of Reaction to a true Northern Worker's paradise. Even if more 'Patriotic' socialists draw links between Lovestone's influence and the MEL's internationalist messaging as some sort of sinister plot to erase Canada, Moriarty is confident that Lovestone's involvement is the best course of action for Canada."
CAN_Nationalist_Market_Socialism:0 "Canadian National Market Socialism"
CAN_Nationalist_Market_Socialism_desc:0 "The influence of Nikolay Bukharin's policies has permeated Socialist circles across the world. While traditionally limited to more moderate circles, a focus on National Market Socialism is a unique facet of Jay Lovestone's Right-Communist ideology. Now that Lovestone's followers are firmly in power, they have begun implementing these controlled Free Market and NeP-influenced policies across Canada."
CAN_Eternal_Revolution:0 "Canada's Eternal Revolution"
CAN_Eternal_Revolution_desc:0 "Canada's Revolutionary Transformation is only just beginning. While the new Red Order may be young, we can not be deluded into letting down our guard. Our leadership has proclaimed that the Revolution cannot end where it stands or stagnation is inevitable, and that without constant vigilance our nascent Socialist Order may be struck down in its prime. Every true Revolutionary must do their duty to ensure that the Royalist taint is never more allowed to pollute our fair land."

### Events ###

canada_soc.1.t:0 "Opening of the Congress of Canadian Socialists"
canada_soc.1.d:0 "After decades of subversion by the Royalists, Canada's many disparate Socialist groups are now free to assemble in the open, no longer burdened by the constant harassment by the RCMP. Now these groups gather in Ottawa to decide the course the newly Socialist nation of Canada shall take, be it one of Totalism, Syndicalism or Radical Socialism.\n\n Controversially, the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation has also been allowed to participate in the Congress. The CCF, while gleefully participating in the King's sham democracy, was also Canada's main 'legitimate' Socialist movement before Canada's revolution.\n\n Almost a dozen groups are in the running, each of them presenting their own array of policies and proposals. As the Congress opens it is still anyone's guess who will come out on top... "
canada_soc.1.a:0 "Let the arguing begin!"

canada_soc.2.t:0 "Fate of the FPU"
canada_soc.2.d:0 "As the Congress of Canadian Socialists opens, one elephant in the room has been weighing heavily on the minds of every faction involved; that being the fate of the Fishermen's Protective Union. The FPU was the first Union in Canadian Territory which successfully managed to rise up against their Capitalist overlords, and while they have forever gone down in history as the Union which freed Canada, their hyperfixation on Atlantic-Canada and Newfoundland issues has been off putting to the wider Canadian Socialist scene, and has made them a stranger to Canada's Socialist Underground. This has manifested in calls by several factions of the CCS calling for the FPU to step down, and allow a more broadly Canadian Union to represent them on a national level. In any scenario, the FPU would remain an exceedingly powerful Union both in Newfoundland and in the rest of Canada. "
canada_soc.2.a:0 "They're right, the FPU should stand down."
canada_soc.2.b:0 "The FPU has proven their ability to wield power on a National Level."

canada_soc.3.t:0 "Fate of the Tories"
canada_soc.3.d:0 "The first issue on the docket for the CCS is the fate of the Conservative Party of Canada. The CPC or 'Tories' as they are colloquially referred to were fervent sycophants for the despotic reign of the British Exiles. Now that the Royalists have been overthrown, the newly-Socialist Canadian Government is tasked with deciding the ultimate fate of the Tories. Hardliners have favoured both illegalizing the Conservative Party and throwing their primary members and organizers in jail. Others have supported simply illegalizing the Organization and any such organization which would spawn in its place. Moderates have favoured an approach which would allow a thoroughly Republican version of the Conservatives to exist in some capacity. "
canada_soc.3.a:0 "Illegalize the Party and throw their members in jail."
canada_soc.3.b:0 "Ban the Tories any any movement which spawns from them."
canada_soc.3.c:0 "Ban the Party itself but allow similar movements to organize."
canada_soc.3.e:0 "Simply arrest the most egregious collaborators."

canada_soc.4.t:0 "Fate of the Liberals"
canada_soc.4.d:0 "The next issue on the docket for the CCS is the fate of the Liberal Party of Canada. The Liberals, while still guilty for playing ball with the Royalist despots, were far less open to the insane demands of the Exiles than their Tory counterparts. While some have disputed the extent of their collaboration, it can not be denied that the Liberal Party was the main 'Legal' front to challenge Exile dominance within the Canadian Political System. This fact, combined with some choice words from certain former Liberal Leaders paints a picture of a Party dedicated to fighting the King's tyranny within the bounds of the legitimate establishment, and that they only played ball with the British due to fear of retribution. Others have been less than impressed with the Liberal's Defense. Hardliners have proposed both illegalizing the Liberal Party and throwing their primary members and organizers in jail. Others have supported simply illegalizing the Organization and any such organization which would spawn in its place. Moderates have taken the Liberal's defense to heart, and have supported allowing the Liberal Party to continue existing in some capacity. "
canada_soc.4.a:0 "Reactionary Scum! Ban the Party and imprison their leaders."
canada_soc.4.b:0 "Dismantle the Liberal Party."
canada_soc.4.c:0 "Ban the Party but let their members go free."
canada_soc.4.e:0 "Allow the Liberals to continue existing."

canada_soc.5.t:0 "Issue of the Economy and Agriculture"
canada_soc.5.d:0 "With Canada's main political issues settled, the CCS has moved on to the question of the Economy. Notably what form it shall take in the new Canada. The CCF has proposed a policy which would institute Public ownership of the Economy while allowing private businesses to still operate. The SPC/SDP/CPC bloc has put forward a similar policy which would favour Collective ownership. The Syndicalist bloc has unveiled a plan which would create a Trade Union Economy, while the CPC/MEL/CUM bloc has put forward their proposal for a fully nationalized Command Economy. Folded in with the Economic issue was the issue of Agriculture, each with a different proposal by the different parties. The CCF supports the founding of agrarian co-operatives, the SPC/SDP/CPC bloc supports the subsidization of Agriculture while the TLC/OBU/WUL/CPC bloc supports the creation of Agricultural unions across Canada. The CPC/MEL/CUM bloc has put forward their own unorthodox policy of forced Agricultural Collectivization, a policy which has received a lukewarm reaction from Canada's Agrarian heartlands.  "
canada_soc.5.a:0 "Collectivization under a Command Economy."
canada_soc.5.b:0 "Form a Trade Union Economy."
canada_soc.5.c:0 "Collective ownership and Agricultural Subsidies."
canada_soc.5.e:0 "A Public Economy with Agrarian Coops."

canada_soc.6.t:0 "Issue of the Exiles"
canada_soc.6.d:0 "The final issue on the CCS's agenda is the matter of the millions of British Exiles who had come to settle in Canada after the British Revolution. While most of these Exiles were wealthy aristocrats trying to avoid reckoning for their crimes, a great deal of B were simple folk merely trying to escape the Red Terror in Britain. Most of the factions in the CCS are ambivalent towards the lower-class Exiles who fled Britain simply out of fears of violence; despite this, much of the CPC/MEL/CUM bloc favour the internment of all Exiles regardless of class, stating that their decision to flee from the Union of Britain was proof enough of their reactionary views. While it is commonly agreed that the hoarded wealth of the Exiles brought across the Atlantic are to be seized, the matter of the Exiles themselves is far more contentious. The Syndicalists support expelling the Exile class altogether, while the SPC/SDP/CPC bloc only wishes to expel the most upper-class Exiles. The CCF favours an approach which would simply seize Exiles wealth and allow them to continue to inhabit Canada and work an honest dollar."
canada_soc.6.a:0 "Intern the Exiles."
canada_soc.6.b:0 "Allow only the poorest Exiles to stay."
canada_soc.6.c:0 "Expel only the upper-class Exiles."
canada_soc.6.e:0 "Seize their wealth but allow them to stay."

canada_soc.7.t:0 "Totalists Win the Day"
canada_soc.7.d:0 "The first Congress of the CCS has drawn to a close, and with it rises a new Government in Canada. Carrying a majority in policy proposals, the CPC/MEL/CUM bloc has been granted the ability to form government, and will be calling the shots in Canada from here on out. Now in power, the question of which faction within the Totalist bloc will lead Canada has arisen. Three different movements encompass the bloc: The Communist Party of Canada, the Marxian Educational League and the Canadian Union of Maximists. The Communists are a broad movement in Canada, without their support splintered between all three main factions in the CCS. The 'Totalist' faction of the CPC is led by Tim Buck, who has drawn inspiration from American Communists such as Earl Browder and Gus Hall. The MEL of William Moriarty also draws inspiration from American Left-Wing figures, albeit in the form of Jay Lovestone's 'Nationalist Market Socialism' instead of Browder's 'Popular Communism'. The final and arguably least influential faction is the CUM, a fringe movement following the ideals of Charter Totalists such as Oswald Mosley and Benito Mussolini. Despite this, the CUM has been described as much more moderate than their European counterparts, gaining them the nickname of 'The World's Most Moderate Maximists'.\n\n As the votes are counted, it is clear that the CCS has elected as their new General Secretary..."
canada_soc.7.a:0 "Tim Buck - Communist Party of Canada!"
canada_soc.7.b:0 "William Moriarty - Marxian Educational League!"

canada_soc.8.t:0 "Syndicalists Win the Day"
canada_soc.8.d:0 "The first Congress of the CCS has drawn to a close, and with it rises a new Government in Canada. Carrying a majority in policy proposals, the TLC/OBU/WUL bloc has been granted the ability to form government, and will be calling the shots in Canada from here on out. Now in power, the question of which faction within the Syndicalist bloc will lead Canada has arisen. Three different movements encompass the bloc: The Trades and Labor Congress of Canada, the 'One Big Union' and the Communist-alligned Workers’ Unity League. All three factions share similar alignment, but have vastly different approaches and origins. The OBU is a militant left-wing Union primarily based in Western Canada. They are notable for leading the 1919 Winnipeg General Strike. The Trades and Labor Congress of Canada is a Canada-wide central federation of trade unions which has often drawn ire by other Socialists for their 'Moderate' and 'Noncommittal' stance. The primary 'legal' Trade Union in Canada pre-revolution, the TLC is affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, and like the AFL shares a stance of Craft Unionism rather than the OBU's policy of industrial unionism. The Workers' Unity League is another militant left-wing organization, albeit one more closely linked with the Communist Party of Canada. They are known for their participation in the 'On to Ottawa' Trek, an ill-fated protest against the relief efforts of the Meighen Government.\n\n As the votes are counted, it is clear that the CCS has elected as their new General Secretary..."

Now in power, the question of which faction within the Socialist bloc will lead Canada has arisen. Three different movements encompass the bloc: The Socialist Party of Canada, the Social Democratic Party of Canada and the moderate faction of the Communist Party of Canada. The Socialist Party of Canada is the most powerful faction within the moderate bloc. Previously rendered defunct, the SPC returned to prominence after the Revolution, representing those disillusioned with both the Syndicalists and the Communists; even if this stance cost the party much of its support base during the Russian and British revolutions. The Social Democratic Party of Canada is a socialist social democratic political party which originally split off from the SPC. In contrast to the Socialist Party of Canada, the SDP allowed minority language groups ample room for self-determination, and represented many former CCFers who left due to the party's increasingly moderate stances. The final 'unofficial' member of the Socialist coalition is the Moderate branch of the Communist Party of Canada.

canada_soc.10.t:0 "The CCF Wins the Day"
canada_soc.10.d:0 "The first Congress of the CCS has drawn to a close, and with it rises a new Government in Canada. Carrying a majority in policy proposals, the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation has been granted the ability to form government, and will be calling the shots in Canada from here on out. This outcome has shocked some, but comes as no surprise to others. The largest 'Socialist' movement in pre-war Canada, the CCF has been allowed to participate in the post-Revolution political scene on the condition they renounce their Monarchist stances and repent for their brazen collaboration with the Canadian establishment. While their status as a legitimate part of the Reactionary political arena has been off putting to hardliners, the CCF's representation of Canada's famously moderate political scene has allowed them to appeal to the masses. The CCF themselves have defended their cooperation with the Monarchy, stating that they only moderated out of necessity, and worked with the Canadian establishment as a way to help the workers of Canada in a broadly legal way. The CCF has also stated that they had planned to do away with the King entirely if they were ever granted the authority to do so. Their election in the first congress of the CCS reflects the shift of Revolutionary factions towards a more moderate stance. Representative of Canada's agrarian heartlands, the CCF's policies have often been described as 'Agrarian Socialist'. Additionally, the CCF holds large tendencies toward Christian Socialist groups such as the Social Gospel Movement, even if the party itself trends towards secularism.\n\n As the votes are counted, it is clear that the CCS has elected as their new General Secretary..."

canada_soc.11.d:0 "The first Congress of the CCS has drawn to a close, and while it was hoped that a new Government would rise in Canada, it appears that no faction has managed to claim the mantle. With no faction rising to the task, several different hypothetical coalitions have been drawn up with the aim of forming a government. After several different chances at forming government lapsed, several different factions of the Communist Party of Canada unified in an attempt to secure a plurality. Formally backed by the Workers' Unity League, the Communist Party of Canada has drawn itself to the center in an attempt to stay united, something which has angered both Moderates and supporters of Tim Buck. Nonetheless, the new 'Syndicalist' CPC has been granted a mandate to govern Canada, and has chosen as their General Secretary Annie Buller, an instrumental figure in the 'On to Ottawa' Trek, an ill-fated protest against the relief efforts of the Meighen Government. Buller's rise to power marks Canada's first female Head of State, and one of the few in the world."

canada_soc.12.t:0 "Leader of the Totalists"
canada_soc.12.d:0 "With their defeat in the first congress of the CSS, the defeated Totalist CPC/MEL/CUM bloc has gathered to elect new leadership to lead them in opposition. Three different movements encompass the bloc: The Communist Party of Canada, the Marxian Educational League and the Canadian Union of Maximists. The Communists are a broad movement in Canada, without their support splintered between all three main factions in the CCS. The 'Totalist' faction of the CPC is led by Tim Buck, who has drawn inspiration from American Communists such as Earl Browder and Gus Hall. The MEL of William Moriarty also draws inspiration from American Left-Wing figures, albeit in the form of Jay Lovestone's 'Nationalist Market Socialism' instead of Browder's 'Popular Communism'. The final and arguably least influential faction is the CUM, a fringe movement following the ideals of Charter Totalists such as Oswald Mosley and Benito Mussolini. Despite this, the CUM has been described as much more moderate than their European counterparts, gaining them the nickname of 'The World's Most Moderate Maximists'.\n\ After the arguing concludes, it is clear that the person chosen as the leader of the Totalist opposition is..."

canada_soc.14.t:0 "Leader of the Syndicalists"
canada_soc.14.d:0 "With their defeat in the first congress of the CSS, the defeated Syndicalist OBU/WUL/CPC bloc has gathered to elect new leadership to lead them in opposition. Three different movements encompass the bloc: The Trades and Labor Congress of Canada, the 'One Big Union' and the Communist-alligned Workers’ Unity League. All three factions share similar alignment, but have vastly different approaches and origins. The OBU is a militant left-wing Union primarily based in Western Canada. They are notable for leading the 1919 Winnipeg General Strike. The Trades and Labor Congress of Canada is a Canada-wide central federation of trade unions which has often drawn ire by other Socialists for their 'Moderate' and 'Noncommittal' stance. The primary 'legal' Trade Union in Canada pre-revolution, the TLC is affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, and like the AFL shares a stance of Craft Unionism rather than the OBU's policy of industrial unionism. The Workers' Unity League is another militant left-wing organization, albeit one more closely linked with the Communist Party of Canada. They are known for their participation in the 'On to Ottawa' Trek, an ill-fated protest against the relief efforts of the Meighen Government.\n\ After the arguing concludes, it is clear that the person chosen as the leader of the Syndicalist opposition is..."

canada_soc.15.t:0 "Leader of the Socialists"
canada_soc.15.d:0 "With their defeat in the first congress of the CSS, the defeated Syndicalist SPC/SDP/CPC bloc has gathered to elect new leadership to lead them in opposition. Three different movements encompass the bloc: The Socialist Party of Canada, the Social Democratic Party of Canada and the moderate faction of the Communist Party of Canada. The Socialist Party of Canada is the most powerful faction within the moderate bloc. Previously rendered defunct, the SPC returned to prominence after the Revolution, representing those disillusioned with both the Syndicalists and the Communists; even if this stance cost the party much of its support base during the Russian and British revolutions. The Social Democratic Party of Canada is a socialist social democratic political party which originally split off from the SPC. In contrast to the Socialist Party of Canada, the SDP allowed minority language groups ample room for self-determination, and represented many former CCFers who left due to the party's increasingly moderate stances. The final 'unofficial' member of the Socialist coalition is the Moderate branch of the Communist Party of Canada. Comprised of several members of the Communist Party of Canada, these members have joined and pledged loyalty the 'Socialist' Bloc instead of the Totalist bloc which the remainder of the party belongs to.\n\ After the arguing concludes, it is clear that the person chosen as the leader of the Socialist opposition is..."
