A strong and powerful neighbor, even weakened by the civil war, was once again able to subjugate the free Turkic-speaking peoples, and Akhmet-Zaki Validi is the main proponent of this bitter loss and the need for the Bashkirs to take control of their people and state into their own hands. In alliance with the Turkestan's pan-Turkists, the new ERK movement, or 'Will', seeks to bring not only freedom and prosperity to Bashkurdistan, but to all Turkic peoples, but only in an Internationale that values the rights and freedoms of small peoples over indulging in Russia's new socialist imperialism.§!"

### Events ###
bkn.1.t: "Rise of Bashkir National Autonomy"
bkn.1.d: "Following the February Revolution of 1917, the Bashkir national movement strongly advocated for national-territorial autonomy. The I and II All-Bashkir Congresses, held in Orenburg and Ufa in July-August 1917, established the groundwork for the creation of a 'democratic republic on national-territorial principles within federative Russia.' The Bashkir Central Shuro, elected at these congresses, worked on preparing for the All-Russian Constituent Assembly. However, the October Revolution brought unforeseen changes. On November 28, 1917, the Bashkir Central Shuro proclaimed the autonomy of Bashkurdistan, declaring it as an autonomous part of the Russian Republic. This marked the beginning of a new chapter, when state institutions, including military, financial, and communications, came under the jurisdiction of Bashkurdistan.\n\nAlthough the Bashkir movement was acknowledged as legitimate, the Soviet leadership refused to recognize Bashkir autonomy despite attempts to gain recognition from the central authorities. The situation escalated, resulting in the arrest of seven members of the Bashkir government and the Bashkir Central Shuro on the night of February 3-4, 1918. In response to the arrests, Bashkir youth, together with members of the Tulqyn organization, formed the Provisional Revolutionary Council (shuro) of Bashkurdistan (VRSB). The VRSB submitted a draft regulation titled 'On the Autonomy of Bashkiria' to the People's Commissariat. However, on March 30, 1918, the Orenburg provincial executive committee condemned the idea of national autonomy and dissolved the VRSB. Repressive measures caused unrest among the Bashkir population. The actions of the Red Guards to confiscate weapons often resulted in violence, which increased tensions. In April 1918, united Bashkir and Cossacks detachments freed members of the Bashkir government from the Orenburg prison. At a secret meeting in Ufa on April 7-8, 1918, it was decided to organize a partisan movement.\n\nBy the end of May 1918, the authorities of the Bashkir autonomy had regrouped in Chelyabinsk after the city's capture by the Czechoslovak Legion. On June 1, 1918, the Bashkir Government called for armed resistance against Soviet power. Bashkir regiments were mobilized, and the Bashkir Military Council was established to manage the Bashkir army. During the civil war, Admiral Kolchak rose to power and declared himself the Supreme Ruler of Russia on November 18, 1918. His government aimed to eliminate national and regional autonomies, including the Bashkir autonomy. When faced with an order to dissolve local authorities and transfer administration, the Bashkir government entered into negotiations with representatives of Soviet Russia. On February 16, 1919, a decree was passed incorporating Bashkiria into the RSFSR, and the territory was renamed the 'Bashkir Soviet Republic'. Without waiting for the end of negotiations, the Bashkir government declared its loyalty to the Soviet power on February 18, 1919, turning its arms against the enemies of the revolution. However, the victory of Kolchak and the White generals over the Bolsheviks marked the end of the Bashkir Soviet Republic. Bashkir leaders who faced persecution fled Bashkiria and Russia. Some, such as Sharif Manatov, found refuge in Paris, while others, including Akhmet-Zaki Validi, found refuge in Turkestan.\n\nNow, amidst the chaos of Russia's new civil war, the exiled separatist leaders have returned, determined to achieve the autonomy they once sought. The story of Bashkir autonomy, characterized by its brief existence, suppression, exile, and ultimate return, unfolds in the ever-changing landscape of post-civil war Russia."
bkn.1.a: "Irekle Bashkurdistan!"

bkn.2.t: "Rise of the Bashkir Military Council"
bkn.2.d: "Amidst the ongoing second Russian Civil War, the situation in Bashkurdistan becomes increasingly complex. The local parliaments and councils of major industrial cities, such as Ufa, are now dominated by workers and peasants of Russian origin. However, a new center of power emerged in the Southern Urals, known as 'Little Bashkiria'. General Ğalimjän Tağan led the charge in establishing the Başqort Harbi Shurah (Bashkir Military Council), which serves as both the provisional government and the General Staff of the revived Bashkir Host. The local milita forces managed to swiftly gain control over key cities and villages in the region.\n\nThe main goal of the Başqort Harbi Shurah is to protect Bashkir interests and achieve independence despite the opposing forces. Now, as Tağan has solidified his power as a provisional dictator, he aims to capture Sterlitamak and Belebey, which are located on the opposite bank of the Ağeđil (Belaya) River.\n\nThe military strength and determination of the Başqort Harbi Shurah represents a significant turning point, as the events ahead on the Ağeđil river will determine the future of Bashkurdistan during this turbulent time, where the fight for independence and self-identity is once again at the forefront."
bkn.2.a: "All of Bashkurdistan will be ours!"

bkn.3.t: "Liberation of Sterlitamak and Belebey"
bkn.3.d: "In a decisive move the Harbi Shurah orchestrates a triumphant liberation campaign. Focused on reclaiming territories, the Bashkir forces, led by General Ğalimjän Tağan himself, set their sights on the key cities of Sterlitamak and Belebey, situated on the opposing bank of the Ağeđil river. Our forces employ strategic brilliance to swiftly advance, gaining control over strategic points and rallying local support. As news of the victories spreads, the momentum of the Bashkir autonomy movement gains strength, setting the stage for the most serious battle - battle for Ufa."
bkn.3.a: ""

bkn.4.t: "Occupation of Sterlitamak and Belebey"
bkn.4.d: "The so-called Bashkir Military Council, known as the Başqort Harbi Shurah, has launched a determined campaign to reclaim what they view as Bashkir core territories. The focus of their attention shifts to the strategic cities of Sterlitamak and Belebey. In a swift and coordinated offensive, the Bashkir forces, under the leadership of General Ğalimjän Tağan, strategically advance, gaining control over key points and rallying local support. The streets, once under our jurisdiction, now echo with the triumphant cheers of the Bashkir population as they witness the capture of Sterlitamak and Belebey. The provisional administrations established by the Başqort Harbi Shurah signal the swift transition to a Bashkir-centric governance structure. The Russian Socialist Republic, now facing setbacks in the region, grapples with the implications of losing control over these key cities. The defiance of the Bashkir forces not only secures strategic points but also inspires a surge of hope and momentum within the Bashkir autonomy movement. As news of the victories spreads, the Russian Socialist Republic must reassess its strategies in the ongoing conflict. The struggle for identity and self-determination unfolds in the face of these territorial losses, shaping the complex dynamics of the second Russian Civil War."

By establishing a specialized department near the mountains, where officers will be selected for training, and by selecting local soldiers, as well as by conducting an active campaign to attract the local population to the mountain units, we expect to create 2 regiments. In addition, we are introducing basic mountain operations vision lessons into the standard officer training courses."
