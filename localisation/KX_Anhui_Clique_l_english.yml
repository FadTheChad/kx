Taking inspiration from the less radical wings of the Chinese KMT as well as heavily from the Qing’s Chinese Youth Party, ZMN fuses Mongolian nationalism with secularist, liberial, and progressive ideologies to create a truly Mongolian strain of liberalism. Advocating heavily for free speech, self-determination, and a total abolition of the current feudal system, ZMN are enticing to many in Mongolia who seek a less radical alternative to the Mongol Ardīn Nam.§!"

These mystics and holymen serve as the advisors and aides to the Bogd Khan, and seek to complete the process of making the Bogd Khan a true monarch of Mongolia. They seek to establish a ‘hereditary’ line where the current reincarnation of the Khan is once again put on the throne as the one mortal form dies and another takes its place, with the Buddyn Zövlöl serving as interim regents while each new Jebtsundamba Khutuktu is found, creating a functional dynastic monarchy founded on Buddhist principles. However, this council is not a unified front, and fundementalist influences have been seeping in, driving many of its members to more radical, extremist views.

ANH_mongolian_unrest: "Mongolian Unrest"
ANH_mongolian_unrest_desc: "Few would claim the Anfu Club make popular overlords for their Mongolian subjects, and yet fewer still if one did not ask the club in question! Ever since their invasion in 1919 in violation of the 63 stipulations the Bogd Khanate signed with the Chinese Republic, the Mongols have not been fond of the Chinese, and the Anhui Clique in particular. These memories is still fresh in the mind of the Mongols, as is their effort to throw the Anhui Clique out with the command of the Mad Baron, a fact which colors much of the Mongol's attitude towards the Anhui led state."

ANH_anfu: "Rebirth of the Anhui Clique"
ANH_anfu_desc: "Long exiled to the Steppe since the disaster that was the Northern Expedition, the Anhui Clique has once again established a stable foothold after nearly dying out after the German Intervention. Once the premier warlord clique in all of China, this collection of diverse conservative generals and intellectuals of the Anfu Club shall now attempt to tame the Mongolian people in their pursuit of reclaiming Beijing and their homelands - the destiny denied to them all those years ago."
ANH_rolling_dice: "Challenging the Baron's Gambit"
ANH_rolling_dice_desc: ""
ANH_drive_out_the_russians: "Drive out the Russians"
ANH_drive_out_the_russians_desc: "In order to restore the glories of the Anhui Clique and retake the lands of our people, we will need a fully sinified environment to launch our crusade into the Middle Kingdom from. Our only obstacle left is the large number of Russian immigrants and settlers left in our borders. These Slavs will be dealt with, for a pure and Chinese Mongolia."
ANH_communications_clique: "Communication Clique's Calling"
ANH_communications_clique_desc: "Always loyal to our interests and the interests of the wider Anfu Club, the Communications Clique have long been our faithful allies and supporters. A cabal of Capitalists, captains of industry, financiers, and other cronies of capital all united in their wish to see our Anhui Clique ruling over China, the Communications Clique is the lifeblood of our economy and one of our only allies in the maelstrom that consumes the Middle Kingdom. We should move to strengthen our ties with their sharp-minded investors, allowing them to fund our industrial build-up and militarization process as we prepare to take China for ourselves."
ANH_promise_autonomy: "A Deal for Autonomy"
ANH_promise_autonomy_desc: "We shall strike a deal with these wild nomads, and a simple one that even brutes like them could understand. We shall promise them nominal independence under our restored Chinese state if, and only if, these savages of the Steppe serve as shock troopers and meat shields for our more valuable military assets. We shall use Chinese brains and Mongol blood to save China, and in return, they will be allowed to keep their wasteland."
ANH_mondernize_mongolia: "The Push for a Modern Mongolia"
ANH_mondernize_mongolia_desc: "Mongolia is a non-industrialized, archaic backwater that reeks of horse dung and dirty peasants. We must bring the modern world to Mongolia, for these riders run and scream from the idea of modernity more like it was their worst nightmare. The Steppe will be tamed, and this wasteland will be made profitable and useful if its the last thing we do."
ANH_grant_mongolian_rights: "Rights for Service"
ANH_grant_mongolian_rights_desc: "Mongols have long been second-class citizens to true Chinese, with the Han majority specifically being particularly harsh against the people of the Steppe. If we are to cooperate with these wildmen, we must stop this. In return for their military service, Mongolians will be given equal rights and privileges before the law and the government to any of our own citizens. Though this won’t stop anti-Mongol attitudes overnight, it is a step in the right direction towards true cooperation and coexistence."
ANH_use_mongol_military: "The Mongolian Meat Grinder"
ANH_use_mongol_military_desc: "Using their peasants as a meat shield and their infamous riders as shock troopers and fast-attack units, we shall use the strengths of the Mongol military doctrine to our advantage as we aim to retake Beijing. With their blood, they shall pay for their freedom."
ANH_exchanges_for_independence: "The Promise of Independence"
ANH_exchanges_for_independence_desc: "With their soldiers forming the frontline of our reclamation army and their peasants toiling in our factories and fields, the Mongolians have proven themselves dedicated to our deal and our cause to retake China. With the even of battle approaching us, we shall assure these masters of the Steppe of our intentions of making good on this deal as we ride, together, towards Beijing."
ANH_New_Administration: "The Return of the New Administration"
ANH_New_Administration_desc: "The ‘New Policies’ or ‘New Administration’ was a series of policies devised by the Late Qing dynasty at the turn of the century that were meant to subjugate, sinisize, and assimilate Mongolia into China proper. Though it originally failed and Mongolia broke free under the Bogd Khan and Ungern-Sternberg, the ideas of this failed program have not. With the Anfu Club’s resurgence, the Late Qing Reforms will once again be forced upon the Steppe as the Anhui Clique seeks to eradicate the Mongol identity and culture from these lands entirely."
ANH_chinese_colonization: "The Chinese Flood"
ANH_chinese_colonization_desc: "The key principle of the New Administration was simple: make Mongolia Chinese, and the easiest way to do that would be to open floodgates and allow full, unchecked immigration from Chinese states into the Steppe. With more people than anywhere else on Earth, we will have no shortage of population centers to pull from, and with these new eager faces arriving in droves, we shall quickly move to outnumber and crowd out the Mongolian peasants."
ANH_forced_sinification: "Mass Sinification"
ANH_forced_sinification_desc: "A state-enforced policy of Sinification must be enacted and heavily enforced if we are to truly tame these wild lands. Mongolian culture shall be erased, their language supplanted for ours, their cuisine adopted and altered, their art and music changed and assimilated, and more. We shall not only tweak Mongol culture, but fundamentally change it so that it is no longer Mongol, but just another form of Chinese."
ANH_erode_faith: "Erode the Mongol Faiths"
ANH_erode_faith_desc: "The lands of the Mongols are home to many faiths we in China do not adhere to. Though we share an appreciation and zealotry for Buddhism, the sects we follow are largely different. In addition to these shallow differences, their appreciation and piety for shamanism, Burkhanism, and the Tengri faiths all work to erode our authority. We shall replace these ancient, pagan beliefs with the pinnacles of Chinese enlightenment such as Legalism, Confucianism, and Taosim, molding the spirits of the Mongols to match our own."
ANH_control_the_khan: "To Puppet a God"
ANH_control_the_khan_desc: "The Bogd Khan was the rallying figure that helped throw off our yoke of control decades ago, but now that we have returned to dominance over the Mongolians once more, he is in little position to oppose us. We must now make a choice on what to do with this aging old fool, for he could make a valuable puppet, but so could his reincarnate replacement, and with us in charge, who is to say it is not within our right to pick his heir."
ANH_breed_out_mongols: "Genetic Assimilation"
ANH_breed_out_mongols_desc: "With their faiths undermined and their culture in ruins, the final solution to the Mongol problem has begun to be enacted by the state. Through incentivized and sometimes even law-required interbreeding and miscegenation, we shall finally eradicate the Mongolian people for good. With these programs, we shall consume the Mongol identity and bloodline itself, allowing it to melt into the vast pool of Chinese genetics. We will steal their future generations as their elders die off, and within a generation or two, Mongolians themselves will be but a distant memory of an uncivilized and savage past."

### Events ###

#the various foreign wolves and vultures that his rule kept at bay were now free to spread across all of Mongolia like parasites and scavengers moving in to rip apart a newly deposited carcass. Of the two main groups of are the Chinese remnants of the Anhui Clique’s political wing - the Anfu Club - who seek to restore Gamin rule over Mongolia and later all of China, and the Soyombo Revival Society, a pro-Russian group composed mostly of old Ungern-Sternberg loyalists and other Russia expatriates who seek to turn Mongolia into a Russian client state bent on retaking Manchuria. Both these groups are well-funded and well-connected, and now it is only a matter of which one shall take over Mongolia and which direction our people will be steered in."

mon.463.t: "Drown Out Mongolic Impurities"
mon.463.d: "The Mongolians are a savage and brutish race of nomadic miscreants and bandits. It is the destiny of China and the Han people to not only subjugate these lands, but to completely and utterly erase every last facet of the Mongol identity from existence. Our pure race is in a perfect position to be able to do this necessary act, and we have just the way to do so without bloodshed. Copying a tactic of the Chinese people that has persisted for centuries, we shall use our massive numbers to our advantage by genetically assimilating the Mongol race. \n\nThrough a series of forced sterilizations, state-enforced miscegenation quotas, population fracturing, and other forms of population control, we shall totally Sinify the Mongolian people, wiping not only their culture, but their very genes from this planet and replacing it with the pure, righteous Han Chinese identity. ‘Mongolia’ as a concept will be a thing of the past within a few short generations as we make the Steppe truly Chinese."
mon.463.a: "We will create a future free from Mongol savagery for the Han and our children."

mon.464.t: "A Mongolian Meat-Shield"
mon.464.d: "To earn our independence and force the Chinese to make good on their deal for autonomy, the Mongolian people must serve as the frontline forces for the coming crusade to retake Beijing. The various nomads and riders of the Steppe and the Gobi have been conscripted to form elite Kheshig cavalry divisions centered around protecting the leaders and generals of the Anfu Club in the heat of battle, while also serving as an elite fast-attack strikeforce and vanguard brigade. Complementing these noble riders and joining them in battle are the numerous masses of arats, or Mongolian peasants, that shall stand together as barely organized rabble serving as a meatshield against the Chinese hordes we are sure to face on the march to Beijing. Though many of these poor, innocent farmers and herders will be brutal cut down, joining the river of blood that flows along these plains with every battle, but so too shall the blood of our enemies join the mix. Without fighting, we will never earn our independence, and fighting, conquest, and war itself is in the very blood of our people. We shall triumph and earn our freedom at last, even if every man in Mongolia has to die to do it."
mon.464.a: "With this blood, we shall pay for our freedom."

mon.465.t: "To Puppet a God"
mon.465.d: "As the Anfu Club and their clique have increased their hold over both the Mongolian people and their spirituality, the final plan to deal with the native Buddhism problem is finally about to go into action. The Anfu Club has plotted to do the unthinkable - to shackle a god to their own will. The Bogd Gegen is weak and ageing fast, nearly dying in 1924 due to a supposed botched assassination attempt by the MAN. His weak position and vulnerability give us a unique opportunity to bind him to our very will. By threatening his life, the life of his beloved wife, and the life of his people, we can enslave this god amongst men to our will, shackling an entire faith to whims of our regime. \n\nAlternatively, we can simply poison this fool, and instead begin the search for the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. However, instead of looking in Mongolia or Tibet, we know that the next Bogd Gegen shall of course be of Han blood, for it is what the stars and the gods dictate to be true! With a truly Chinese Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, the Gelug Bhuddist faith shall forever be tied to China."
mon.465.a: "Though his health is failing, we can prop him up. The Bogd Gegen shall serve as the perfect puppet."
mon.465.b: "We shall dispose of this old fool and search for his ‘true’ replacement. Of course he would reincarnate in China!"
