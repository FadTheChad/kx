black.1.t:0 "This is not meant to be here!"
black.1.d:0 "If you see this please report on the paradox forums!"
black.1.a:0 "I'm serious REPORT IT!"
black.2.t:0 "Black Monday"
black.2.d:0 "On the third of February 1936, the Berlin Stock Exchange stopped sinking - it plunged. Fuelled by the instability of the market panic, selling erupted as soon as the stock market opened on Monday morning.\n\nIt took well into the night for the teleprinters to stop sputtering out the results of what became known as Black Monday. When the results had been analysed, it was clear that the situation had only got worse.\n\nThe shock of this unprecedented economic catastrophe will, no doubt, be felt over the entire world. The German golden age has ended - for now, at least..."

black.6.t:0 "War Stimulates the Economy"
black.6.d:0 "Due to the war, industrial production across several sectors has skyrocketed and the workforce has endeavoured to fulfil their patriotic duty. This has had a net positive effect on the economy by reducing the aftermath of the Black Monday crash. It seems the economy is finally showing signs of life!"
black.6.a:0 "Excellent."
black.7.t:0 "Financial Troubles in the Colonies"
black.7.d:0 "Some maverick politicians proposed distributing more resources to the colonies to the detriment of the German national, which would obviously not be popular..."
black.7.a:0 "Dedicate as many resources to the colonies as they need."
black.7.b:0 "Only cover the most critical expenditures."
black.7.c:0 "Tighten our belts. We can't help them in our dire times."

### Austria and Black Monday ###
black.200.t:0 "Black Monday hits Austria"
black.200.d:0 "Just mere hours ago, the Berlin Stock Market, one of the most prominent stock markets in the world, experienced a sudden mass panic as stocks began to plummet. Within hours, news had spread all across the city and the Kaiserreich itself, prompting the streets to swarm with people attempting to pull their funds out before it was too late. Despite German efforts to stem and support prices, the market has fallen even further. The panic has totally annihilated hundreds, if not thousands, of German investors, and as Germany is so closely linked to Austria, not to mention many seeing its rising machineries and technology advancements, Austria's investors have found themselves in a monetary grave.\n\nThe era of Austrian post-war reconstruction has been totally halted - many nobles find themselves squandering and debating whether to sell off jewels or properties. As the House of Habsburg and the central governments of both Cisleithania and Transleithania lack any real funds, the economy is in total freefall.\n\nTies have been severed and the inter-imperial network of economic investment spearheaded to rein in the fraying constituencies have been all but effectively decommissioned. With these vital roads cut and the constituencies basically told that they are on their own, a second Habsburg miracle is in order - already a more independent status has been exercised by Bohemia and Galicia-Lodomeria. Hungarian nationalists have called for uprising, a call thankfully ignored, but with the paramilitaries of the Archduchy already out in the streets and the Danubian Internationale screeching for benefits with unemployment hikes to all-time highs, Austria enters its most dire strait yet."
