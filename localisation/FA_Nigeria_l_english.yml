### Ideas ###
NGR_Clifford_Legacy:0 "The Clifford Constitution"
NGR_Clifford_Legacy_desc:0 "Our last administrator Hugh Clifford made many changes to our constitution, allowing for proper representational democracy for colonials and generally promoting a more indirect system of rule in Nigeria. It's no Westminster, but it is certainly making our country more stable."

NGR_Northern_Tensions:0 "Northern Tensions"

NGR_nigerian_identity:0 "A Nigerian Identity"
NGR_nigerian_identity_desc:0 "Azikiwe has done the unthinkable and come to power with a nationalist message. Now he will work to free Nigeria of foreign greed and inspire a new sense of nationalism in his people."
NGR_army_reforms:0 "Army Reforms"
NGR_army_reforms_desc:0 "Stockwell has won the election and now hopes to revamp the Nigerian military to be far more efficient and perhaps even in line with German tactics and organization. This will take some work, but he is confident that he can accomplish this goal in his new position in power."
NGR_free_trade_idea:0 "Free Trade"
NGR_free_trade_idea_desc:0 "We should aim to liberalize the economy, as the British did in their prime. By encouraging greater trade with our neighbors and even nations on other continents, our markets will prosper and money will fill our pockets."
NGR_central_bank_idea:0 "Nigerian Central Bank"
NGR_central_bank_idea_desc:0 "The idea of a central bank is not unique to Nigeria, and we have closely studied its implementation elsewhere. For a more efficient economy, we must create a Nigerian Central Bank, and we can only grow as a result of it."
NGR_home_army:0 "A New Home Army"
NGR_home_army_desc:0 "Like the British Army of old, Nigeria must have a home army. To do this, we will model ourselves after the old British model, while also using our new law code to help impose some forms of conscription. Soon we will have the best army in all of Afrika!"

NGR_prussian_example:0 "Emulate the Prussians"
NGR_prussian_example_desc:0 "For decades, if not centuries, the Prussians have had the most competent military in the world. Now that they are our overlords and we have the ability to do so, we should seek to emulate them."
NGR_german_instructors:0 "German Instructors"
NGR_curb_british:0 "Weakened British Influence"
NGR_curb_british_desc:0 "The British are a thorn in the side of our administration. Seeing themselves as above the Africans and sometimes even the Germans, they have often refused to cooperate with our government, especially financially. It is time to end this problem."
NGR_curb_british_2:0 "German Trade Deals"
NGR_curb_british_2_desc:0 "Though some argue we are replacing one overlord for another with our new German trade deals, the Germans are clearly much better partners than the British. They do not demand exemption from any financial obligations, and they are willing to pay fair prices for our products. Even better, they don't live here."
NGR_french_aid:0 "Entente Aid"
NGR_french_aid_desc:0 "We have reached out to the Entente for aid, and our request has been granted! This is the first step in fostering closer relations with our old allies."
NGR_nigerian_people_aid:0 "The People's Government"
NGR_nigerian_people_aid_desc:0 "We have no need for foreign rulers; we have appealed to the Nigerian people for aid instead! With their help, we will gain independence before we know it."
NGR_nigerian_assistance:0 "Nigerian Aid"
NGR_nigerian_assistance_desc:0 "The Nigerians, under the loyal Bernard Bourdillon, have sent us much needed supplies to help in this time of great crisis. They aren't much, but we appreciate the gesture nonetheless!"
NGR_Class_Divisions:0 "Native-Colonial Divide"
NGR_Class_Divisions_desc:0 "Since the beginning of the Nigeria colony, there have been tensions between the European settler population and the various native Nigerian tribes. These tensions still characterize politics in the colony today, and as natives increasingly lobby for equal rights, so too do the settlers entrench themselves in their position in favor of an unequal colony."
NGR_Class_Divisions_Improved:0 "Softened Class Divisions"
NGR_Class_Divisions_Improved_desc:0 "We have agreed to grant the Nigerian natives certain additional rights, such as easier access to education, but we have not gone so far as to grant them the full extent of the rights enjoyed by colonials. For now, this will hopefully satisfy the Nigerian people."
NGR_Class_Divisions_Equal:0 "Nigerian Equality"
NGR_Class_Divisions_Equal_desc:0 "We have decided to grant full equality to the Nigerian people, putting them on par with the colonials in every way. This has come with certain benefits, such as more manpower for research into diseases and even morale boosts for Nigerian workers, but it will also anger the European settlers."
NGR_curb_brits:0 "Reduced British Influence"
NGR_curb_brits_desc:0 "The British have had a stranglehold on Nigeria's economy for too long! We must crush their influence if we hope to develop our economy; they only hold us back with their greed. And, by reducing their influence, we can open the door for new German investments..."
NGR_curb_brits_2:0 "New German Influence"
NGR_curb_brits_2_desc:0 "With the British influence weakened, the country is now ripe for German investment. Already German companies are flooding into the colony, ready to do business, and soon the economy shall be run by Germans, not the British settlers."
NGR_righteous_cause:0 "A Righteous Cause"
NGR_Spiritual_War_Idea:0 "Spiritual Warfare"
NGR_Spiritual_War_Idea_desc:0 "Recently, the tensions between the north and south of Nigeria have only worsened. The government has given us the green light to proceed with a sort of "spiritual warfare" in the north to try and restore security. This will unite our troops for the time being, but we cannot hope to beat a religion in a war. Such open warfare can only be temporary, until we find a better solution..."
NGR_federalism_idea:0 "Federal System"
NGR_federalism_idea_desc:0 "With a system that gives representation to both the Yoruba and the Igbo, we will have a much more secure state, and can face both the northerners and any outside forces more efficiently."
NGR_Northern_Tensions_Neighbors:0 "Appeals to our Neighbors"
NGR_Northern_Tensions_Neighbors_desc:0 "The German colonization has done much to destabillise the north. Religious tensions are at an all time high as Islamic millitants in Hausaland wage holy jihad against our government. Luckily, Westafrika and Kenya have agreed to provide some limited aid, but this will not fully solve our crisis."
NGR_Northern_Tensions_Soldiers:0 "Mercernary Contracts"
NGR_Northern_Tensions_Soldiers_desc:0 "The German colonization has done much to destabillise the north. Religious tensions are at an all time high as Islamic millitants in Hausaland wage holy jihad against our government. Luckily, we have secured contracts with mercernary groups. While these will provide some limited aid, they cannot not fully solve our crisis."
NGR_Northern_Tensions_Reich:0 "Mittelafrikan Help"
NGR_Northern_Tensions_Reich_desc:0 "The German colonization has done much to destabillise the north. Religious tensions are at an all time high as Islamic millitants in Hausaland wage holy jihad against our government. Luckily, Mittelafrika has agreed to assist us, but they cannot solve our crisis for us. More must be done."

NGR_northern_solution_peace:0 "A United Nigeria"
NGR_northern_solution_peace_desc:0 "With Nigeria fully under our control, we can now look towards a better future and we can perhaps focus on our neighbors..."

### Focuses ###

NGR_splittingattheseams:0 "Splitting at the Seams"
NGR_splittingattheseams_desc:0 "Nigeria is a nation in turmoil: the north is in revolt, our law system is falling apart, and worst of all, there is little to no help from Berlin. We must come up with creative solutions to the crisis at hand if we hope to survive as a colony and as a nation."
NGR_fromlagostosokoto:0 "From Lagos to Sokoto"
NGR_fromlagostosokoto_desc:0 "It is not uncommon for outsiders to underestimate the size of Nigeria, but they do so at their own peril. Nigeria is truly massive, but we aim to govern it in its entirety. The first step to doing so will be to establish infrastructure, beginning with a new road connecting Lagos and Sokoto."
NGR_cliffordslegacy:0 "Clifford's Legacy"
NGR_cliffordslegacy_desc:0 "When Hugh Clifford governed Nigeria, he instituted many beneficial programs, the most important of which involved education and administration. In education, he aimed to establish primary schools for every child, training colleges in every province, and even a royal college in the region. Administratively, Clifford made every attempt to westernize the region, and his work paid off. We should continue his legacy and go further, allowing representative democracy and indirect rule in Nigeria."
NGR_movetowardsfederalism:0 "Move Towards Federalism"
NGR_movetowardsfederalism_desc:0 "Moving towards a federal system in Nigeria will stabilize our regime significantly. This is because the nature of federalism, with its states and tiers of administration, is best suited for a diverse country like our own. It will also help quell any revolts before they even begin, as all regions of the country will have representation. "
NGR_spiritualwarfare:0 "Spiritual Warfare"
NGR_spiritualwarfare_desc:0 "One of the largest obstacles to a united Nigeria is our religious divide. Tensions have only risen in recent years, and relations between Christians and Muslims in Nigeria have come to a head in the form of spiritual warfare. This warfare does not bode well for our stability..."
NGR_someoutsidehelp:0 "Some Outside Help?"
NGR_someoutsidehelp_desc:0 "The situation in Nigeria seems untenable, at least for our administration. However, if we appeal to outside sources for aid and explain the situation, we are sure to find some sort of relief, though we must decide who this aid will come from."
NGR_thesoldiermarket:0 "The Soldier Market"
NGR_thesoldiermarket_desc:0 "There is a widespread but often ignored mercernary market in Afrika. Appealing to them for aid is the best solution if we want to confront local strife head-on, but it will come at a cost. Are we willing to pay for stability?"
NGR_theafrikanreich:0 "The Afrikan Reich"
NGR_theafrikanreich_desc:0 "Appealing to the Afrikan Reich is our best bet for aid, as they are the most powerful force on the whole continent. Their forces could swiftly crush the Muslim rebels, and the funds they can offer would be more than enough to solve our troubles. However, such aid could come with unwanted scrutiny and control from Göring and his administrators, so we should consider this option carefully before taking it."
NGR_ourfellowprotectorates:0 "Our Fellow Protectorates"
NGR_ourfellowprotectorates_desc:0 "The best course of action to solve our national crisis would be to appeal to our fellow protectorates. Our neighbors have their own troubles, but if we can work together, perhaps we can quell our respective troublemakers together. We should send word of our perils at once."
NGR_ourfirststrike:0 "Our First Strike?"
NGR_ourfirststrike_desc:0 "Now that we have secured outside aid and gathered our own resources, it is time to decide how we will tackle our internal dissent. We could target Islam itself, try to restore order in our Northern territories, or try to address the concerns of the dissenting groups. What shall we do?"
NGR_atislam:0 "At Islam"
NGR_atislam_desc:0 "Islam is the root of all the northern dissent, and thus, it must be dealt with. Targeting an entire faith will be unpopular, not just at home, but in the Muslim World as well. Nonetheless, such a direct measure may be the only way to solve our problem."
NGR_atdissent:0 "At Dissent"
NGR_atdissent_desc:0 "The reason we have such chaos in our country to begin with is that our citizens have unment needs and desires. We should try to address these concerns, in the hopes that this will finally resolve the disputes. The first concern we must address is that of administration; the northern states want more autonomy. We must grant them this..."
NGR_apermanentsolution:0 "A Permanent Solution?"
NGR_atlawlessness:0 "At Lawlessness"
NGR_atlawlessness_desc:0 "Anarchy reigns supreme in Nigeria, though this has not always been the case. We must restore some semblance of order if we are to survive and prosper. Only by placing power in the hands of local administrators can we hope to achieve this."
NGR_apermanentsolution:0 "A Permanent Solution?"
NGR_apermanentsolution_desc:0 "On closer examination, it seems our problem is unsolvable without changing how the state itself is run. Two solutions have been presented to us. With a one state solution, we could wield more influence in the region and generally prosper, but only if we can find a satisfying compromise to the current crisis. On the other hand, a two state solution would leave us divided, but our crisis would be solved once and for all, and we could rest easy."
NGR_onestate:0 "One State"
NGR_onestate_desc:0 "We will consolidate our territories into one state once and for all. This will not be easy for northern dissidents to accept, but we now have what we need to suppress them should they cause trouble. Towards a bright future for Nigeria!"
NGR_twostates:0 "Two States"
NGR_twostates_desc:0 "We have decided to pursue a two state system. This will remove the northern half of our country from our control, but perhaps this is for the best, as the region has only been trouble for our administration. Only time will tell what the future of Nigeria will hold..."

nigeria_intro.1.t:0 "Nigeria 1919-1925: Nigeria After the Great War"
nigeria_intro.1.d:0 "When Nigeria first entered the first Weltkreig, a swift defeat for the German Colonial Forces was predicted. While their predictions for Africa were correct, it seems that their hopes for victory in the wider Empire were far off the mark. The Entente's loss in the Great War was cause for great anguish for many, both Colonial and Native. While the Royal West African Frontier Force had great success against German forces in Kamerun, Kraut victories in Europe ultimately ensured that not only would the Jerries remain in control of their African possessions, their Colonial Empire would grow further. Even though Britiain's Colonial Empire escaped unscathed, especially compared to the rather harsh fate which befell their French Empire, British pride remained badly damaged, something which led to increasing tensions with Natives. However not all was chaos in the wake of the Entente's defeat, as the 1922 Clifford Constitution built the foundations for true representative democracy in the Colony. The reign of Hugh Clifford was generally seen as the golden age of the colony, as his administration sought to greatly expand education in the colony. However, good times don't often last, and for Nigeria it was no different, as the colony would soon be faced with a crisis greater than any other..."
nigeria_intro.1.a:0 "I think I know how this one goes.."

nigeria_intro.2.t:0 "Nigeria 1925-1935: Things Fall Apart"
nigeria_intro.2.d:0 "By the onset of 1925, it became clear to all subjects of the Empire that something in Britain was horribly awry. The fall of France to Syndicalism had implanted the ideals of revolution in the minds of every downtrodden worker in Britain. Soon, the seeds of revolution came to harvest as the United Kingdom fell to a Syndicalist uprising. With London incapacitated, the vast British Empire soon fell into chaos. Dozens of worker-led and native revolts began pop up across British colonies across the world, as the long-suffering subjects of Imperialism seized the chance to break their chains. Fortunately for us, Nigeria would not meet the fate of the United Kingdom proper... unfortunately, the status quo would still perish in the flames of revolution. The Germans, our not-so-friendly neighbors jumped at the chance to occupy the British colonies, declaring their intervention nothing more than a friendly mission to crush the attempts at uprising in the wake of the United Kingdom's collapse. The British Colonial Office, now relocated to Ottawa, could do little but lodge a weak protest as the Germans came to be our new overlords. While we were spared the shame of amalgamation like our brothers in Kenya and Uganda, and were not befall occupation like Zambia, Nigeria would be forever changed. The 1925 crisis would start our Colony's delicate dance between Berlin and Ottawa, one which shows no signs of letting up."
nigeria_intro.2.a:0 "And then what happened?"

nigeria_intro.3.t:0 "Nigeria in the Present Day: The New Old Order"
nigeria_intro.3.d:0 "To a layman, it would seem that the Nigeria of 1936 differs little from the Nigeria of 1922. The same British officials run the show, or at least they do on paper, and the Colonial order appears to remain set in stone. Yet under the surface, tensions mount. The decapitation in our chain of command after the 1925 Revolution has forced us to increasingly rely on German support to keep the Natives in line. Simmering tensions in the North made way for an active armed uprising by Hausa militants, one which the bickering of German and British officials has failed to resolve. The Germans, increasingly frusturated with British incompotence, have begun sending their own officials to manage Nigeria; much to the anger of the Exiles. At the dawn of 1936, the increasing hostilities between loyalists to Ottawa and Berlin have been cause for great concern. As it seems, scheming officials in Dar es Salaam are intent on claiming the valuable Oil River colony for themselves, all while British Loyalists look for their opportunity to return to Entente rule. Hugh Clifford, who was set to depart as Nigeria's Governor practically on the eve of the British Revolution has found himself serving ever since, becoming the longest serving in the colony's history. The machinations of British and German officials have not allowed a replacement to be picked, even as Clifford's tenure drags on to almost two decades. Here in Nigeria, nobody knows who to take orders from, be it the German Kolonialamt or the British Colonial Office. When Hugh Clifford does eventually retire, it seems that whichever side maintains primacy will be the one to pick his replacement."
nigeria_intro.3.a:0 "How terribly complicated."

nigeria.2.t:0 "The Death of King George V"
nigeria.2.d:0 "With great sadness, it has been announced that King of the United Kingdom in Exile, George V, has tragically passed away today. The final Monarch of the United Kingdom to reside in London, and the last to represent the British Empire at its zenith, many within our administration hold fond feelings for the late King. While George V still remained our King throughout the German occupation, the exact status of the British Monarchy within the Protectorates remains messy at best. Before 1925 the Royal sucsession would proceed without issue, however now the matter is not so clear. Some are eager to usher in the reign of Edward VIII as King of Nigeria, others support a much more muted approach, keeping our official statements limited to mere condolences and leaving the issue of the Nigerian Monarchy foggy. Regardless of our message, it seems clear that it will have little effect, as the Germans will still remain our overlords no matter what. Still, making our loyalty to the Crown clear would send a powerful message to the Germans."
nigeria.2.a:0 "A simple letter of condolence will do the trick."
nigeria.2.b:0 "Long Live Edward VIII, King of Nigeria!"

nigeria.3.t:0 "Black Monday Hits the Oil River"
nigeria.3.d:0 "A telegraph from Dar-es-Salaam has reached Lagos with the most terrible news. The Stock Market has taken a dive, the German Economy has collapsed and now the entirety of the German Colonial sphere is in the red. Mittelafrika, as our primary trading partner, is now seemingly broke. Nigeria, as loosely strung along de-facto dependency of the German Colonial office, with undoubtedly be met with harsh budget cuts as a result. As the government takes stock of its financials, people have been quick to dispense blame; as many, especially loyalists to the Entente, claim that Nigeria would have been spared from the consequences of this crash if we weren't shackled to the Kaiser's empire. Others aren't so quick to blame the Krauts, further providing the fact that even the Canadians themselves have been faced with the effects of Black Monday as evidence."
nigeria.3.a:0 "A horrible, if not unavoidable event."
nigeria.3.b:0 "A direct consequence of German overlordship."

nigeria.16.t:0 "An Ally in Afrika"
nigeria.16.d.brits:0 "The old British and French colonies in West Africa and Kenya are natural allies for us; they have similar histories under European control and they chafe under German rule just as we do. We should reach out to these nations in the hopes of establishing even closer relationships and perhaps one day, we will return to the British crown."
nigeria.16.d.native:0 "Ethiopia is a nation that has admirably resisted colonial rule; we should reach out to them and foster closer relations if we hope to be independent ourselves one day. They have a proud history, perhaps even more so than ours, but they understand the cost of freedom, and we should study them to see what their secrets are!"
nigeria.16.d.germs:0 "We must aim for closer relations with Mittelafrika if we are to survive these difficult times. Their government sees us as an unwieldly state, and it is true. However, if we are to reassure them of our loyalty, we can begin to cooperate more closely than ever before and hence create new stability in the country."
nigeria.16.a:0 "Off to Kenya!"

However, our new freedom has come at the price of our security, and now we must find ways to secure our new borders from our neighbors as well as threats from across the ocean. We should also address the elephant in the room; the north has broken off from our main territory, and is now trying to act independently of us! One way to deal with all these new challenges would be to align ourselves with the Entente, and help them in their fight to liberate Europe from the syndicalist menace. We should do everything we can, both on the continent and elsewhere, to fight for the king. One day soon we will return to our place in the empire!"

We should also address the elephant in the room; the north has broken off from our main territory, and is now trying to act independently of us! One way to deal with all these new challenges would be to look within and to other states in Afrika, with the hopes of possibly creating an alliance.

nigeria.18.t:0 "Considering Our Loyalties"
nigeria.18.d:0 "Now that German rule has essentially collapsed in Afrika, we should decide our loyalties once and for all. Already we have made some attempts at finding allies, but we will need more than diplomatic overtures if we want to protect our national security interests. Most of our advisors are pressuring us to sign a military alliance of sorts. The Unionists wish to see us align with the Entente, and perhaps eventually even rejoin the British Emipre. Meanwhile, the Collaborationists want us to remain loyal to Germany, even if Mittelafrika and the other German colonies have collapsed. The Nationalists have scoffed at both suggestions, arguing instead for internal -and external- unity to fend off any threats. It seems that this external unity involves Nigeria's neighbors, and some Nationalists hope to bring them under our control in one way or another. Regardless, we must decide what our next course of action should be."

nigeria.19.t:0 "Fighting Northern Dissidents"
nigeria.19.d:0 "The populations in the north of Nigeria, largely Muslim and belonging to the Hausa ethnic group, have agitated for what they call 'better treatment' for years now. In reality, it seems that it would be more accurate to describe their goals as having everyone in the government collectively close their eyes and let them break away unnoticed. This will obviously not do, so we have put a few different plans together for how to deal with these northern rebels, should they ever truly break away. Our spies report that prominent rebel groups in the region are biding their time, waiting for the right opportunity to break away. They argue that the northerners would not dare break away unless Nigeria was in some sort of crisis. Regardless of how well we plan for this event, we should also do everything we can to prevent a rebellion before it ever happens. The first step in our response will be to send in elite German and Nigerian troops to eliminate the worst of the rebels, and hopefully defang the movement as a whole. However, this will only be the beginning, even if it does succeed, and we should plan for prolonged counter-insurgency tactics in the north."

nigeria.200.t:0 "Bornu's Fate"
nigeria.200.d:0 "The future of the breakaway state of Borno is a question on the minds of all Nigerian statesmen, and it has been since the collapse of the nation. Though they have their own identity, in some ways, allowing them to leave would harm our regime and perhaps fracture the country into even smaller polities. We cannot afford to let them break away completely. There are a few options available to us, however. We could offer a trade deal that would essentially see Bornu become a subservient economy, or we could give them an ultimatum to rejoin our nation or face war. Regardless of what we decide, we must decide soon, lest they find allies and slip out of our hands forever."
nigeria.200.a:0 "Sign a trade deal!"
nigeria.200.b:0 "Make the demand!"

nigeria.20.t:0 "Nigeria demands we return!"
nigeria.20.d:0 "It was only months ago that we broke away from Nigeria and founded our own state. However, our former allies have not been idle since that time; they have been looking for any excuse to force us back into the nation as a whole. Despite our best wishes, they have now given us an ultimatum: we can either rejoin Nigeria or face an invasion. We cannot hope to fend off an invasion on our own, but perhaps we could hold them off long enough for them to lose interest. Or, we could accede to their demands and rejoin the nation. What should we do?"
nigeria.20.a:0 "Very well, we will rejoin..."
nigeria.20.b:0 "Never!"

nigeria.21.t:0 "Bornu chooses war!"

nigeria.22.t:0 "Bornu accepts!"

nigeria.23.d:0 "Though all agree that Hugh Clifford left an enduring legacy on the nation, there is much disagreement on how we should continue his work. There are various aspects of life in Nigeria that Clifford improved: the administrative efficiency of the government, the military's discipline and size, and even the ability of the colony to trade with Germany and its neighbors. Our advisors note that we could go in any one of these directions, but not two or even all three of them, as this would be far less efficient and cost money we do not have. So, which of these 'legacies' should we pursue?"

nigeria.24.t:0 "Prepare for War?"
nigeria.24.d:0 "One of the largest disputes among Nigerians is faith. Christianity and Islam are confined to different spheres of the country, but this only makes unity more difficult. Tensions have risen in recent years, with the influx of German administrators upsetting the old balance and forcing us to craft some sort of response. Unfortunately, some of our advisors insist that a response should be both militaristic and religious in nature, targeting the Muslim populations in the north. This is unlikely to yield any real results, but we can use the concept of a spiritual war as propaganda while the government attempts to craft real solutions behind the scenes."
nigeria.24.a:0 "To war, sort of!"

nigeria.25.t:0 "Let Hausaland Go?"
nigeria.25.d:0 "Our oldest citiziens can remember a time when Nigeria was divided into many states, a time when ethnic groups enjoyed either self-rule or a great deal more autonomy than they do now. Now that German rule has collapsed, it is time to reconsider this arrangement. To make things more pressing, the Northern People's Congress, a party founded to represent northern Nigerian interests, has led Hausaland to declare independence from the South. There are many in Lagos and elsewhere who have been recently energized by Nigerian or Pan-African nationalism, chiefly the National Youth Movement, and call for the north to be brought back into the fold. Hausaland has refused to negotiate and insists that we respect their separation, an arrangement that existed as late as 1914. Should we declare war or allow them their independence?"
nigeria.25.a:0 "Bring them back!"
nigeria.25.b:0 "Let them go."

nigeria.26.t:0 "The Future of Nigeria"
nigeria.26.d.brits:0 "Despite our best attempts to unify the country under our rule, it seems that it will take time and careful governance to create a sense of national identity; we cannot force it. Edward Twining's policy of giving more representation to natives has soothed tensions somewhat, but we will need to further orient our policy towards the natives with regards to their diverse nature. More than any group, the Yoruba ethnic group in the Southwest of the colony has been given power, but if we extend this to the Hausa in the north, we may just bring some stability back to Nigeria. When the King controlled our colony, it was split into two regions, and though this is not desirable, we should understand their desire for some power within our government. A stable Nigeria would be more likely to be granted dominion status, should we choose to rejoin the British Empire. On the other hand, we could do the unthinkable and allow them to break away. The north is underdeveloped and has only caused trouble for our government in the south, and we would be even more stable as a unified south than as a unified nation. What should we do?"
nigeria.26.d.native:0 "Though we call ourselves the Nationalists, our various factions mainly hold power in the south. Herbert Macauley's newspaper, which has been so important for our movement, is quite literally called the "Lagos Daily News". Nnamdi Azikiwe, meanwhile, has some roots in the north, but he is more acquainted with Lagos, Ghana, and even America. We cannot be nationalists if we do not also include the northern Hausa in our government. After all, both the Yoruba and Igbo groups have representation in our government, despite their rivalry. At the same time, we could allow the Hausa-dominated region to break away, and make do with the south. The National Youth Movement has protested this, but pragmatism may take precedence over idealism. What should we do?"
nigeria.26.d.germs:0 "The Kaiser's rule is strong in Nigeria thanks to our help, but we will have to come to a more permanent arrangement with the north if we are to keep the colony together. Their desire for representation is no different from the calls for representation in the south, and we would be wise to grant them some sort of power. However, such power would likely mostly be on paper, and we would ensure we kept control over the primary administrative, military, and financial matters of the colony. On the other hand, we might be more useful to the German Empire as a purely southern colony; the region is more developed, and we could focus our resources on the motherland, not fighting Muslims in the north. We must make a decision."
nigeria.26.a:0 "Give them their representation..."
nigeria.26.b:0 "Let them go!"

nigeria.27.t:0 "Asking For Help"
nigeria.27.d:0 "It is clear to all involved that we need outside assistance if we hope to crush the stubborn northern resistance. There are several options we could pursue in the hopes of remedying this crisis. We could appeal to Westafrika, Kenya, and others, colonies who have similar problems and could potentially send men or money to get the job done. There is also the local mercernary market. These mercernaries would obviously be more expensive than our own forces, but we may need the boost they could provide, given that they are much better trained and equipped than our own national forces. Perhaps Mittelafrika would also be willing to assist us, especially given the fact that any conflicts in our region could spill into their directly-owned territories. These options all have their pros and cons, but we must do something before it is too late. What will we decide?"
nigeria.27.a:0 "Talk to Westafrika and Kenya"
nigeria.27.b:0 "Hire some of these mercernaries"
nigeria.27.c:0 "Appeal to Mittelafrika for help"

nigeria.28.t:0 "Addressing Yoruba and Igbo tensions"
nigeria.28.d:0 "There is much attention on the current north-south divide in Nigeria, but colonial administrators forget that the south of the country is quite diverse as well. The Yoruba ethnic group is primarily located in the southwest of Nigeria, and they have more power than perhaps any other ethnic group in Nigeria, thanks to their location. However, the Igbo ethnic group has contested this power as tenaciously as the Hausa, though with more success. From this rivalry came the first moves towards a federal system in our colony, and further implementing such a system would certainly be possible, given our high degree of autonomy within the German Empire. The only downside for us may be that the Hausa will ask for representation as well, so that by solving one conflict we will exasperate another. Regardless, if the Hausa ever do become a threat, we will need a unified south to stand a chance against them, and so we must move forward with federalism!"
nigeria.28.a:0 "One step closer to unity!"

nigeria.29.t:0 "Status of Religion"
nigeria.29.d:0 "An issue that has plagued us for decades is the status of religion in the nation. In the pre-colonial days, Islam and traditional religions were dominant in Nigeria, but with the introduction of colonial rule and Christianity, the situation has only become more complex. The British and Germans after them understood that they had to protect the Muslims in the north and the Christians in the south if they were to rule with any effectiveness, though for all the efforts of the Germans, tensions have risen in recent years. Part of this tension stems from power; the southern ethnic groups have far more power than the northern ones, and the Muslim Fulani and Hausa groups have accused the government of bias towards Christian Nigerians. In addition, there is significant tension caused by the northern desire to impose sharia law on the entirety of the region. It would be unthinkable for us to grant such a demand, but perhaps a system in which native leadership alternates between Muslims and Christians would suffice in giving the Muslims the power they desire. This would be a painful deal, but one that may need to be made to ensure Nigeria's continued unity. What should we do?"
nigeria.29.a:0 "Offer power tradeoffs on religious grounds"
nigeria.29.b:0 "Pressure them to give up sharia law"

nigeria.30.t:0 "Improving the Government System"
nigeria.30.d.colonial:0 "The question of how to govern Nigeria has troubled colonial administrators since the inception of the colony itself. At first, the British opted to grant local rulers some authority in a "Nigerian Council", but eventually the administration evolved into three distinct regional systems: north, southwest, and southeast. In the north, the British took care to respect the Muslim faith, and in the south, British rule was assured by the Legislative Council. This system was effective because the British employed indirect rule and had the approval of local rulers, and it is a system that the Germans have done their best to emulate. Outside observors see a Nigerian colony, but anyone familiar with the region knows that the north, southwest, and southeast are all fiercely independent and have significant differences. Though we have been granted more autonomy as of late, this state of affairs also comes with a downside: we don't have the power or resources we once did. As such, we must come to an arrangement that will satisy all populations in question, and the best proposal to do this is through a federal system. We have taken steps to move closer to a federal system in the past, but if we were to solidify it now, we would codify the already-existing regional arrangements while also working to unify the nation. It is an efficient solution, but some colonials complain that it will reduce their influence in their respective regions, and leave them without enough power to respond to crises. It seems that implementing an official federal system will be a...leap of faith, but perhaps a necessary one if we want to maintain control over the north. What should we do?"
nigeria.30.d.native:0 "The issue of federalism in Nigeria is one that the northern Hausa have pushed relentlessly; turning the region into a federal state would guarantee the autonomy they have traditionally held. Certainly, granting such a system using the old British colonial borders would give the north more than half the population and enough power to dominate the south. This is a fact that both sides are aware of. On the other hand, if we can modify the borders somewhat, the power imbalance will be much less significant. The Hausa would obviously protest such a demand, but if they had to choose between a modified federal system and no federal system at all, they might reconsider. It is a risky maneuver nonetheless, but one we will likely have to accept if we want to keep Nigeria united. What should we do?"

nigeria.32.t:0 "Macauley and Azikiwe"
nigeria.32.d:0 "The story of the birth of a unified Nigeria identity is a fiery one. Throughout its long history, the region now known as the Nigerian Free State has been marred with ethnic clashes and division. From the Benin and Hausa kingdoms of old to the Kanim Borno and Edo Benin states that fell with the rise of the British Empire, many have tried to unify these lands, but all have failed. That was until the Europeans played their final hand in their imperialist crusades and carved up our continent without remorse or thought to who resided here. Even the greatest of empires must fall, and as the Lion once roared over our lands, now screeches the Imperial Eagle of the Huns. Their arrival and brutality, however, has proved to be their undoing as the fires of their colonial ambition has also given spark to the Nigerian people as well. Long divided over religion, language, and regional or cultural identities, many began to use the Nigerian people’s new common enemy to foster a kinship that would never falter. No more important to this forging of a unified spirit was none other than Olayinka Heelas Badmus Macaulay, or as he is more commonly known, Herbert Macaulay. None in our lands can deny that he is the main architect, the father of Nigerian nationalism. His work over his long life has been to the betterment of his fellow Nigerian, holding many disciplines over his career in analytics, surveying, musical composition, author, and statesmen to name a few. \n\n In his old age, being born in 1864, Macaulay has taken a particular liking to a certain Nnamdi Azikiwe, current party leader of the Nigerian Front Party, a party they co-founded together in the wake of the German occupation after their victory in the Weltkrieg. Macaulay has served as a mentor to the young politician, bonding over their national views, Pan-African leanings, and a shared dream of a free Nigeria. With ‘Zik’ now party head, Macaulay has taken a back seat to politics in the colony, allowing Azikiwe to propel to the national forefront, and becoming one of the major candidates in the upcoming 3rd Nigerian Parliament elections. Macaulay had officially endorsed Azikiwe in the recent elections, and with Azikiwe’s recent win that shocked the nation, Macaulay can relax in his semi-retirement, knowing the future of the Nigerian people is secure."

nigeria.33.d:0 "It has come to our administration’s attention that our colonial brothers in Kenya have been besieged and defiled by vile Marxist rebels known as the Mau-Mau. Little more than armed rabble, mainly made up of disgruntled farmers and labourers, their persistence has proven to be quite a thorn in the local administration's side. Many in our parliament clamour that we must send aid, while our more Hawkish MP’s want to directly intervene and help the Kenyan Frontier Force dismantle and eradicate the Mau-Mau completely. Interestingly, this has been one of the few resolutions in recent memory that has been widely agreed on by both the Anglos, who seek to help their brethren in Kenya, and the Germans, who seek to preserve Mittelafrika’s integrity and prestige. The only main opposition are certain members of Nmamdi Azikiwe’s Nigerian Front Party, whose Pan-Afrikan ideals impassioned them to the Mau-Mau. Despite this small camp, ‘Zik’ himself and the rest of the hardliners strongly agree with intervention or aid, as they are none too fond of Marxism’s taint and its potential to infect our pristine continent."

Separated by the hundreds of miles between Benin and Monrovia, the two constantly send correspondence and host each other at various events and visits; the topic of discussion almost always revolves around Pan-African ideals. African art, music, culture, religion, history, politics, the list goes on and on. Though Garvey is admittedly the far more radical of the two, their differences in small details on the Black struggle is far overshadowed by their similarities and deep friendship. These two titans of the movement both hold high aspirations for themselves and their peoples, and with their cooperation, the Black Man may finally earn their long-held dreams of freedom."

Though true, total independence would be years, if not decades, off into the future, but by instituting economic and political reforms to strengthen and secure our economy while empowering the Nigerian people, ‘Zik’ could guide the nation towards an independent future. With authoritarianism and autarky, Azizikwe plans to carry Nigeria towards its rightful destiny. These measures have begun to make many in the party nervous, and debates in party meetings have grown more turbid and venomous. Chief among these critics of ‘Zik’ has been Obafemi Awolowo, Pan-African firebrand and loud-piece for the more disenfranchised and downtrodden of Nigeria. Though not openly a leftist by any means, Awolowo holds *questionable* views on certain issues regarding leftists, such as his open stance of solidarity with the Mau-Mau, not as a fellow Marxist but as a fellow African. In parliament, the Nigerian National Party maintains its facade of complete and unwavering unity, but on the inside, the smallest of cracks are beginning to show."

Now, with the reins of power in his hands, and with the entire colony now at his command given his democratically-secured mandate, Zik must make a decision on how to go forth and lead, or rule, his people. \n\nLong despising separatists, regionalists, and monarchists, Azikiwe instead has always advocated for cooperation between the democratic and nationalist forces of Nigeria, even working with socialists such as his friend, and oftentimes rival, Obafemi Awolowo to achieve his dream of a free and sovereign Nigerian nation. Now with the power to dictate the future of his people and his nation, he is left with a choice. Zik could stay true to his democratic principles and push for the fair Nigerian republic he has always dreamed of, but the circling wolves of former colonials and opportunistic foes have given the honored statesman a reason to reconsider his positions. \n\nIf he were to abandon his democratic principles, even if only temporarily, it would be to steel the Nigerian people into a single and unified force ready to defend their culture and their borders at any cost - a noble cause but not one that necessarily requires him to resort to authoritarianism - the very habits he and his people have languished under for decades.
