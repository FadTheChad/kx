POLITICS_WILHELM_II_DESC:0 "Born 27 January 1859, Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert ascended the throne upon the death of his father, Frederick III, in June of 1888. He quickly oriented the German Empire into new belligerence, starting with the dismissal of Otto von Bismarck. With a renewed interest in expansionism the German Colonial Empire grew larger, and the Ruhr steadily became the manufacturing hegemon of Europe. His relentless ambition, however, had easily led Germany into conflicts with its neighbors, including a naval arms race with the United Kingdom and foreign policy that ultimately isolated Germany from most of the great powers.\n\nThis situation, resulting in Germany having to carry the burden of "weaker" allies, was what it had to contend with during the Weltkrieg. Yet Wilhelm remained steadfast throughout the conflict, having asserted himself many times against both the military and civilian leadership and refusing to accept a peace that wouldn't bring Germany glory. Shockingly, he also practiced caution when his generals advocated reckless aggression. The pivotal moment came with the Kaiser's silent approval of the Hindenburg-Ludendorff Dictatorship, the result of which would not only irrevocably change German politics but also finally bring the Weltkrieg to a victorious end.\n\nYet the Ludendorff Dictatorship would slowly chafe upon Wilhelm II, likely due to his lack of personal control over the aging general. Once Ludendorff's intrigues had failed, his friendship with Hugenberg evaporating, and he lost the favor of the Kaiser, Wilhelm found it easy to force the dictator's resignation and bring in his personal ally Alfred von Tirpitz. Tirpitz's chancellorship was far more amenable, and the 'Golden Years' of Tirpitz's rule made the Kaiser generally confident that his fatherland could now run itself, so long as he maintained a guiding hand.\n\nHis domain over the Kaiserreich has now stretched to nearly 50 years, longer than even the old Kings of Prussia, and he watches with both pride and caution over his fiefdom. Having seen the revolutions which shook many European nations erase relatives and rivals alike, Wilhelm now sits as one of the last symbols of the old order on the Continent, surrounded by hungry rivals. The worsening situation has led the concerned Kaiser to wonder if it would be wise to step into politics once more and ensure his crown is not torn asunder..."
POLITICS_WILLY_3_DESC:0 "Born 6 May 1882, Friedich Wilhelm Victor August Ernst, eldest child of Kaiser Wilhelm II, has now ascended to the throne as Kaiser Wilhelm III. While Prince Wilhelm has been known for a lot of things, from his love of association football to his fondness for Tudor architecture, his most headline-making of traits would be his intensive support for his father's Weltpolitik. Wilhelm III had long held a predilection for German expansionism, immediately seeking a generalship upon the commencement of the Weltkrieg. While his initial failings in starting the Verdun Offensive had caused many generals to reassess the role of the nobility in the military, his close coordination with Kurt von Schleicher and better showing during the Kaiserschlacht had been what the Kronprinz needed to return to Berlin as a hero to his people. Basking in the glory of the Adler's capture of the mantle of world power imbued the future Kaiser with an insatiable hunger.\n\nIn the post-Weltkrieg world, Wilhelm III would utilize his relationship with Kurt von Schleicher to remain politically relevant, promoting his ideology of hierarchy during the November Uprisings and eagerly casting doubt upon the generals who once criticized him when time came for the Ludendorff Dictatorship to fall. While he has been able to gain popularity due to his messages against the likes of Hindenburg, his repeated visits to numerous paramilitary organizations had definitively harmed his reputation among many Germans. The most furious of onlookers had come to be Wilhelm III's own father, who, over time, had to persistently forbid his son from making obvious political sympathies public.\n\nYet as Wilhelm III now sits upon the throne of the Kaiserreich, commanding its prestigious armies and its ocean-going navy, none can know what the war hound may desire. From an enhancement of German power to simple maintenance of the present Weltreich, the possibilities now stand endless before the new head of the House Hohenzollern."

POLITICS_STRESEMANN_DESC:0 "For many politicians their early years are formative to the positions they will champion through their career. This could not be more true in case of Gustav Stresemann. Born in 1878 to a Berlin beer merchant and an innkeeper, the young Stresemann inherited his parents' acumen for trade and developed an adoration for German Romanticism. During his time as a student his political activism started, writing for the Allgemeine Deutsches Universität-Zeitung and rallying against policies like naval armament and the alignment of student groups towards the SPD.\n\nIn 1901 Gustav would begin his political journey in earnest, joining the local Dresden chapter of Friedrich Naumman's National-Social Association. Stresemann easily took to the group's ethos of Mitteleuropan advocacy, oppositions to socialism and blending of syncretizationliberal values. Stresemann would then join the NLP proper in 1907, having prior organized associations against conservatives in agriculture and heavy industry.\n\nBefore the Weltkrieg started, Stresemann was exiled by the NLP inner circle after his support of select social programs. Afterwards, he promoted naval expansion as a guarantee of German global trade, something which together with Albert Ballin's work to form a friendship between the Empire and the United States could ensure the Reich's economic dominance. This bend to patriotism alongside annexationist views during the Weltkrieg kept Stresemann relevant.\n\nStresemann's would ultimately become chairman in 1917 to maintain NLP independence against the hastily expanding DVLP. Despite Stresemann's tacit support of Ludendorff, he became disillusioned with the elitist politics of the regime. When Tripitz's Grand Coalition came to be, Stresemann organized a group of National Liberals, remnants of the Free Conservatives, parts of Zentrum and the right-wing of the FVP into an official "internal opposition". With the Admiral's death a new road opened for Stresemann, a chance to bring his concept of Germany as an economic world power and the unifier of Europe to fruition."

POLITICS_MAX_WEBER_DESC:0 "The German Empire is full of intellectual revolutionaries or ambitious reformers, and the National Liberals have found their own man: Max Weber. Born in Saxony on the 21st of April, 1864, to a parliamentarian of the NLP, Weber's home life was possessed by talks of academia and politics. Weber was deeply influenced by this atmosphere, becoming immersed in intellectual pursuits and even going so far as to read all forty volumes of Goethe during his time as a student.\n\nWeber would satiate his appetite for politics by dabbling in associations such as the Verein für Socialpolitik, Evangelical Social Congress, and even the Pan-German League through the 1890s while remaining part of the faculty at the Royal Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin. Weber's early writing would come to influence Naumann's creation of the National-Social Association, and he steadily became a recognized academic figure. This reputation would only flourish further with his eventual founding of the German Sociological Association and his publishing of "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism", the first of his works to outline his pessimistic vision of a society ruled by rational-legal systems.\n\nWeber finished his magnum opus "Economy and Society" in 1929, the glory of the Tirpitz Years shining through his prose, affirming his imperialist opinions, alongside his growing cynicism of the enlarging imperial bureaucracy. Afterwards, he steadily rose from an intellectual heavy-weight in the NLP to one of its leading figures. Weber's individualist oriented sociology found strong support in the post-Weltkrieg German Empire, especially as a counter to the collectivism associated with Émile Durkheim. Despite his critiques of the modern capitalist system, Weber remained convinced of the innovational value associated therein, and has thus remained positioned against socialism, syndicalism and conservatism.\n\nNow as Reichskanzler, Weber seems poised to bring many of his ideas, namely his dream to free the German people from a future trapped within the "iron cage" of modernity, to reality."

POLITICS_SCHLANGE_SCHONINGEN_DESC:0 "If one were to look at the circumstances of his birth and early career, not much could have pointed towards a humble Lutheran son of a large rural estate owner becoming the Reichskanzler. Yet, this is exactly what happened to Hans Schlange, a student of agrarian sciences who took his second surname in honor of Schöningen, Pommern where he was born on 17 August 1886. Not much would have hinted at a political bend to the young man too, since beyond heeding the Weltkrieg’s call for patriotic duty, wounded for his Fatherland in the process, he had no inclination towards anything other than vague monarchism.\n\nHaving returned from the war to manage his family’s estate, Hans would be swept up in the success of the DVLP and join the Pomeranian chapter of the party as an ardent advocate for the Hindenburg-Ludendorff dictatorship in the interests of stability. If not for the downfall of the nationalist general, Schlange- Schöningen would perhaps still contribute to the Völkisch atmosphere in his homeland, but the Tirpitz reorganization forced the man to change his perspectives.\n\nHans moderated, becoming increasingly closer to the Deutschkonservative faction within the Grand Coalition, working closely together with Kuno von Westarp to control the redirection of politics. The culmination of this “dediabolization” would be the eventual split and exit of Schlange and his agrarian allies from the now Hugenbergist DVLP.\n\nThe political vehicle he created during his break with the pro-Junker Alfred Hugenberg, the Christlich-Nationale Bauern- und Landvolkpartei (Christian-National Peasants' and Farmers' Party), would enter the DkP as a group filling the niche left by the comparatively rightist and pro-large farmer policies of von Westarp. Only time will tell If this alliance of “moderates” and small to medium farmers is enough to preserve Germany and its peasantry."

POLITICS_WESTARP_DESC:0 "Either by coincidence or by providence, Reichskanzler Westarp's career seems to mirror the German Empire itself. Born 12 August 1864 in the humble town of Ludom, Posen, Kuno Friedrich Viktor Graf von Westarp had both much and little to his name before his ascent. An Ascanian heritage, a promising time as a student, and an early interest in politics. This, alongside a fiery Völkisch stance in the Bund der Landwirte, easily placed him into the German Conservative Party, which he came to hold much sway in in 1913 as a stalwart rightist.\n\nThe German Fatherland Party's formation upon Hollweg's resignation proved advantageous, Westarp's support for unrestricted submarine warfare pleasing the quadrumvirate of Ludendorff, Hindenburg, Kapp, and Tirpitz. As editor of Kreuzzeitung, Westarp became a central speaker as he aided in the rightward shift of politics, basking in the glow of victory as the DVLP won in 1922. However, after Ludendorff's fall from grace, Westarp came to the camp of Tirpitz and became the main force of a "moderate" right in the Grand Coalition of 1927.\n\nContent to not hold the reins while the Admiral-Chancellor was alive, Alfred's death in 1930 forced him into action to keep chaos from possessing the Reichstag. While Ulrich von Hassell, Tirpitz's son-in-law and a political independent, would be put in power by the Kaiser, Westarp waited and grew a base of his own as the new leader of the DVLP, Alfred Hugenberg, ostracized many. The DkP flourished as many sought stability and erasure of the dictatorship's sins, granting Westarp's party a sweeping victory in 1932. To reduce the SPD's gains, Westarp formed a deal with Papen of Zentrum to keep the right-wing in control.\n\nAs the "Unshakeable Prussian" remains Reichskanzler, the status quo stands strongly, with the violence of the November Uprisings or the repression of the Ludendorff Dictatorship fading to bitter memory. However, time is marching on, and many wonder if von Westarp, arch-conservative and aristocrat that he is, has the energy to march along with it..."

POLITICS_LETTOW_VORBECK_DESC:0 "Born 20 March, 1870, the "Lion of Africa", Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, son of a minor noble family in Pomerania, had followed the path of many of his sort. From the cadet corps in Potsdam to, ultimately, an officer commission in the Deutsches Heer, Lettow-Vorbeck's time in the military had firmly shaped his world view. The discipline demanded of Prussian men was a trait he had done his utmost to carry even through his participation in putting down the Boxer Rebellion and his efforts against the Herero in Südwestafrika, yet the conduct of anti-guerrilla campaigns often forced him to less than glamorous warfare.\n\nAll these early campaigns with the Schutztruppe would prove to give Lettow-Vorbeck the knowledge he needed to evade and harass the British throughout the whole of the Weltkrieg, earning him nothing short of a near-mythical heroic status across Germany. Alongside the likes of Manfred von Richthofen and, at the time, Erich Ludendorff, Lettow-Vorbeck earned the status of one of Germany's finest martial figures. In this capacity he easily became involved with rightist elements, yet also gestured against the Ludendorff Dictatorship as it shifted further into the far-right.\n\nThis bend towards the right-wing hasn't affected Lettow-Vorbeck as much as it did other military figures, as the Lion's popularity remains consistently high among the populace. To many, he represents Germany's illustrious empire in the flesh, a man who conquered the Dark Continent and firmly thrashed the Entente in the arena of battle. His friendship with members of Der Stahlhelm notwithstanding, Lettow-Vorbeck is lauded with respect across the aisle, and with the Chancellorship now his to command the Kaiserreich seems certain to continue its battle for its place in the sun under a reassessed vision of colonial ventures."

His path since maturity was that of the ordinary Prussian noble officer, first entering the Kadettenanstalt Oranienstein and then the Royal Prussian Main Cadet Institute at Groß-Lichterfelde. He began as an infantry officer, and his early promise had made his superiors be more than happy to grant him promotions and send him to staff positions. Rundstedt spent most of the Weltkrieg in administrative positions, being more of a witness and reacting strategist to the war than an active participant, but he had spent his time in offices wisely. His peers could speak well of him, and he had come to learn the many nuances of high command and planning.\n\nAt the war's end, Gerd von Rundstedt had used his connections to evade Ludendorff's ire for his lack of participation in the dictatorship. His apolitical nature, believing that a general's responsibility was war, granted him much prestige when Ludendorff fell, and he has now become a favorite among the General Staff. Having coalesced much of their opinions and thoughts for reform and then mixed in his own, Rundstedt now stands as one of the leading potential policy-makers in regards to military reform.§!"

Trained as an infantry officer in the Bavarian Army, he eventually rose to command the Bavarian I Army Corps, all while travelling extensively, taking up carpentry, and fulfilling his duties as a prince of the Bavarian royal family. In 1913, he became the heir apparent of the Kingdom, and a year later, he was assigned to lead the German Sixth Army during the Schlieffen Plan. Though his assignment was made due to his royal status, he proved to be an able and innovative commander. At the same time, however, he used his military command to push for Bavarian interests - refusing to withdraw his army from the Western Front to defend Prussia and thus forcing the General Staff to move troops from Belgium instead.\n\nIn July 1916, he was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall and was assigned to command the Army Group Rupprecht, a rank he has held onto until today. In 1921, after the passing of his father, Ludwig III of Bavaria, Rupprecht was crowned as the new King of Bavaria, and since then reigns as a constitutional monarch with respect for the laws and institutions of his homeland. Though having to occupy two chairs at once may seem exhausting for some, the King seems none worse for wear, and dutifully awaits Germany's next great war.§!"

His father, an agricultural administrator, hoped for his son to follow the same career path, but he instead volunteered for the Prussian army and served with distinction in the Franco-Prussian War. In the years following the war, Mackensen broke expectations one after the other, bypassing the three-year preparation period for the General Staff and later serving as an adjutant to Wilhelm II himself, the first commoner to do so. On the Kaiser's 40th birthday, he was ennobled, becoming August von Mackensen, and was assigned to command XVII Army Corps - a prestigious position, as Crown Prince Wilhelm now served under him.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, he was one of Germany's most successful and prestigious commanders, assigned to front after front in Europe - Galicia, Serbia, and finally Romania, shattering Entente resistance in all three campaigns. He returned to Germany a war hero and a Generalfeldmarschall, and continued to serve in the Army thenceforth. By now, however, von Mackensen is over eighty years old, his sharpness has dulled and his body is no longer as able as it once was - most assume retirement is coming soon, the only thing that matters is when.§!"

A modern royal well-liked within German society, a competent equestrian and a student of administrative law, he began his career in the army in 1911, commissioned to command the 1st Life Hussar Regiment. When the Weltkrieg began, he rose to command the 5th Army, and then the Army Group Kronprinz Wilhelm, despite his young age and lack of military experience. His influence in decision-making on the front was minimal, however, and Wilhelm instead used the prestige of his position to support Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff - he described the ousting of Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg as "the most beautiful day of his life".\n\nCrown Prince Wilhelm returned from the Western Front a war hero, and continued his duties as the heir apparent. In the post-war years, he has retained his position in the Army, while growing increasingly close with the German right wing - especially Kurt von Schleicher, who is a friend and ally of Wilhelm's.§!"

Much like the rest of his extended family, he followed a career in the military. After six years in the cadet corps in Plön and Groß-Lichterfelde, he was commissioned into the Third Foot Guards Regiment - and reached the Weltkrieg as an infanrtry lieutenant enrolled in the Prussian War Academy. The war put an end to his studies and sent him to the front - both East and West, in several front and several world-renown campaigns, ending with the victorious march into France in 1919.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Manstein remained in the army and continued climbing the ranks, having shown his talent and intelligence in the years prior. As a newly inducted member of the General Staff, he toured countries across Europe to study their military facilities and breakthroughs in new tactics, while additionally putting special attention upon the reformations of the Polish military, all while developing his own. Regarded as an innovative commander with a knack for unorthodox strategies, he is one of the main proponents of combined arms, mobile warfare in the German army.§!"

After his time in the cadet corps in Plön and Groß-Lichterfelde, he was commissioned into the Third Foot Guards Regiment. It was here that he first met the future politician and one of the most influential men in Germany, Kurt von Schleicher. They formed a lifelong friendship and supported each other in their careers from then on out.\n\nHammerstein-Equord served as a staff officer during the Weltkrieg and continued rising in rank after its conclusion. In the divided Deutsches Heer, he was a supporter of von Seeckt's reforms, which would transform the army into a smaller, yet more professional force that would adapt all of the newest principles of war. Schleicher tactically backed this faction, at least for a while, and after he became the Prussian Minister of War, he pushed his lifelong friend into the highest office of the OHL, consolidating his power over the Army and giving him a powerful base for his political ambitions.

He would have little chance to use his decades of experience on the frontline though, as he was soon selected to staff duties shortly after the outbreak of the war. Though hesitant to leave his position as a battery commander behind, he nevertheless approached his new position with vigour and natural skill, eventually rising to the position as chief of staff to Paul von Hindenburg by the end of the war.\n\nImpressed by the scientific advances made in warfare during the Weltkrieg, von Vollard-Bockelberg would use his position on the general staff to foster close connections with the armaments industry and lead to his appointment to the newly established Army Weapons Office (Heereswaffenamt).

His crisis management and decisive command during the Kaiserschlacht, and an eventual blessing from Hans von Seeckt, easily set Model on the road to the general staff.\n\nWalter Model's experiences during the Weltkrieg, especially in the most brutal battles of the Spring Offensive, together with his attitude combined to make him avow the "war of will" doctrine.

It was during the war, most notably at the Battle of Arras during the ill-fated Nivelle Offensive, that Kesselring showed his aptitude with constructing clear battleplans. During the Weltkrieg he maintained an interest in the development of air power, noting how it had drastically altered the dimensions of warfare. A moment of experimentation came when, during the German intervention in the Russian Civil War, Kesselring had attempted to synchronize the attacks of planes with an infantry assault. Despite limited success, he began to grow more convinced in the promise of air power.\n\nHis Eastern Front experiences would solidify a distaste for Socialism, yet also his committment to aerial development. When the Weltkrieg had ended Kesselring, whose strengths in managing smaller units earned him recognition, was transferred to Mittelafrika. Contending with the inhospitable brush and enemies who regularly evaded conventional tactics, Kesselring began to draft his main reform plans that included a "modernization" of the Jaeger units of Germany.

Be it stories of his father's service as a Prussian officer to the numerous garrison soldiers he saw, the militarism of Prussia was ingrained in him early, and so in 1903 he left home to join a cadet school. Despite lackluster results in his final exams, he entered the army as an officer cadet in 1907 and would serve as a communications officer at the onset of the Weltkrieg. In this capacity he was in charge of signals intelligence, and would fight most prominently at the Battle of Verdun, forming a reputation as a commander with wit yet also biting sarcasm. His later periods of military involvement were mostly within the Eastern Front, most notably his participation in garrison forces in the Don Kuban area. It was while witnessing the early maneuvers in the Caucasus, ultimately being part of the main push to Moscow during the Russian Civil War, that he had first become enamored with tank warfare. Both sides of the conflict were still thoroughly testing their armored units, with many soldiers on the ground having never seen a tank before, and so Guderian got to see firsthand a wide array of uses for panzers that the terrain was more than suited to. Most notable for the still-learning commander, the presence or supremacy of tank units seemed to be the deciding factor of victory or defeat in a few battles, a fact which Guderian would firmly take to heart.\n\nHis interest in armor was exacerbated by a formed friendship with Ernst Volckheim upon his return to Germany, with Volckheim introducing him to the possibilities of armored assaults and wider operations as the technology was being further developed. Guderian was quickly set ablaze with inspiration, taking Volckheim's own ideas even further and trying to build what connections he could to obtain panzer testing projects for himself. While he has grated on his ally Volckheim for being far more outspoken about panzers and speed, his enthusiasm and dedication to innovation has made him quite popular with other members of the Heer who want to expand on the Empire's nascent panzertruppen. As a result, Guderian stands as a star choice for reforming the Deutsches Heer into a posture of far more aggressive mobile warfare.§!"

It was during the Weltkrieg, where all the modern weapons of the world's leading nations were pitted against one another, that Becker's belief in technological supremacy as what won wars would become solidified. This mentality is what he brought with him to the HWA as soon as the guns fell silent.\n\nBecker has now become involved in virtually every scientific project of the Deutsches Heer, from rocketry to even secretive research in uranium.

The armor was experimental, but quite influential, especially during pivotal moments in the Kaiserschlacht. Early on, Volckheim began to understand the strengths and weaknesses of armor, notably that it could only function in conjunction with infantry support. He would complete the war as Germany's foremost "expert" on tank matters due to his practical knowledge, and would further develop this experience in the post-Weltkrieg world by developing the Kaiserreich's new "Panzertruppen" further.\n\nVolckheim would ultimately come into contact with Heinz Guderian, a general who also had been affected by tanks during his experiences in the German intervention in Russia, and the two would cooperate in developing their ideas. Volckheim, however, remained much more conservative than Guderian, and prefers a general motorization of the army and a strong core of armor rather than sweeping armored thrusts and Guderian's policy of nearly all operations revolving around tanks. Due to this attitude, Volckheim has become a front-runner of a cautious, if still innovative, wing of the Deutsches Heer that is enamored with mobile warfare.§!"

GER_totalist_party:0 "Spartakus, BdF"
GER_totalist_party_long:0 "Spartakus, Bund der Frontkämpfer\n§LSpartacus, League of Front-Line Fighters§!\n§gThe Spartacus League, once the largest association of leftists that Germany had ever seen and wielding enough power to threaten the government itself, now can only limp on as the far smaller BdF (League of Front-Line Fighters). The BdF was properly formed in 1919 in the aftermath of the November Uprisings by Heinrich Laufenberg alongside the disparate other survivors, with the rest of the Spartacists finding themselves dead or forced to live far beyond the borders of the German Empire. Laufenberg's leadership has seen the remnant group shift even further into far-leftism, now regarding the democratic socialism as promised by the USPD as being a dead end for revolutionary action, and so now the BdF finds itself in the same ranks as the Jacobins of France or the Maximists of Britain. The BdF itself stresses the importance of cooperation with these other far-left entities in order to complete the transformation of the German Empire into a communist society, and it also is known to cooperate with various other underground organizations within Germany itself. As wide of a faction as it is it still stresses the importance of Anti-imperialism, Marxism, and now National Bolshevism in the interest of the German proletariat.§!"
GER_syndicalist_party:0 "FAUD"
GER_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Freie Arbeiter-Union Deutschlands\n§LFree Workers' Union of Germany§!\n§gThe FAUD is an anarcho-syndicalist trade union that enjoys the privilege of existence in the face of shutdown from the central government, despite its role within the November Uprisings. Either due to its size, its resentment towards the far-left, or the lack of direct action from its leader, Rudolf Rocker, the FAUD was mostly untouched and continues to organize workers predominantly in the Ruhr valley and various other industrial centers of the German Empire. This de jure lack of a crakdown however came with censure within newspapers and a ban on mass organization, and often politicians that find themselves openly aligned with the FAUD are pushed out of their parties in favor of other candidates. Regardless, despite these troubles, the FAUD has remained committed to the anarcho part of its platform, expressly due to the intellectual interests of Rocker himself, and so the FAUD tends to fail as an alternative to the SPD for the average worker. For the time being though, the FAUD remains the only substantial syndicalist group in the German Empire, preaching about the values of anarchism, anti-militarism, and anti-totalitarianism.§!"
GER_radical_socialist_party:0 "USPD"
GER_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\n§LIndependent Social Democratic Party of Germany§!\n§gThe USPD was formed in 1917 as the divide between anti-war SPD members and their party allies became too much for the former to bear, leading them to create their own radical party separate from the SPD. The USPD quickly became a hotbed of revolutionary thought and a safe haven for formerly exiled leftists within Germany, advocating pacifism, democratic socialism, and Marxism. Their political zenith would be found in the November Uprisings of 1918, where they would cooperate immensely with the Spartacus League in a direct revolution against the Reich government. The failure of these uprisings has evidently permanently crippled the USPD as a political force, with many of their charismatic leaders executed or exiled in the aftermath of the uprising. Now, the USPD is headed by the far-less-revolutionary Paul Levi, who continuously restricts the party from ever exercising anti-government violence ever again.§!"
GER_social_democrat_party:0 "SPD"
GER_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\n§LSocial Democratic Party of Germany§!\n§gOriginating in 1863, the SPD is one of the oldest parties in Germany. During the Weltkrieg, this strength was threatened when the SPD split in two between the "mainline" SPD and the radical anti-war USPD. After the failure of the November Uprisings, the party shifted further into nationalism to survive the German Red Scare. Despite prior government sanctions, the fall of Ludendorff allowed the SPD to join the Grand Coalition led by Tirpitz for the 1927 elections, pushing more anti-war and anti-imperialist members out of the party. While still supporting voting reform and welfare programs, a noticeable current of patriotism can also be seen. The SPD's voter block is the strongest among the lower classes and the industrial areas along the Rhine.§!"
GER_social_liberal_party:0 "FVP"
GER_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Fortschrittliche Volkspartei\n§LProgressive People's Party§!\n§gCreated in 1910, the FVP is the social liberal alternative to the NLP. The FVP was a staunch opponent of the Ludendorff dictatorship, supporting political liberalisation and electoral reform. Thanks to the FVP's strong support among liberal civil servants, as well as its intellectual heavyweight and current leader Thomas Mann, it has easily become an effective bourgeois opposition party. Nowadays the group represents interests of liberal elites, romantic nationalists, and large swaths of academia. Their platform includes wide electoral reform, liberalization of society, strong economic intervention, and heavy investment in the German culture.§!"
GER_market_liberal_party:0 "NLP"
GER_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Nationalliberale Partei\n§LNational Liberal Party§!\n§gCreated in 1866, the NLP began as a prominent backer of the Bismarck chancellorship. However, after his turn to the right the party's influence waned immensely. The NLP was powerless in the Reichstag during the Weltkrieg, especially as the center lost influence. After the rise of Tirpitz, the NLP joined the Great Coalition, supporting German colonialism, army expansion, and liberal economic policies. Stresemann's patriotism combined with the admission of Max Weber, famed sociologist, slowly transformed the NLP into a competitive force. Although historically close to the economic elite, Weber's growing popularity has brought more of the entrepreneurial middle-class, anti-Junker businessmen, and various individualistic academics to the party's fold.§!"
GER_social_conservative_party:0 "Zentrum"
GER_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Deutsche Zentrumspartei\n§LGerman Centre Party§!\n§gCreated in 1870, the Zentrum has traditionally represented German Catholics with the Kulturkampf hardening its federalist views. Later due to the actions of the leader of the parliamentary faction Matthias Erzberger, the party would be the architect of the Reichstag’s Peace Resolution of 1917. They would ultimately join with Tirpitz's Great Coalition in an effort to build broader appeal, but Erzberger's less than patriotic stance often hurt the group, leading to Franz von Papen's current de facto management of the party. Regardless, Zentrum has pulls in support of not only German Catholics but also anti-Centralization groups and disaffected workers unwilling to join the SPD. Recently as well, Papen's right-wing has pushed Zentrum into an uneasy coalition with the DkP, for the time being.§!"
GER_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "DkP"
GER_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Deutschkonservative Partei\n§LGerman Conservative Party§!\n§gThe DkP, founded in 1876, was deeply influential in the Bismarck era, leading the cause of protectionism and centralizing the new German state beneath Prussia. Ultimately, the party's power would wax and wane throughout the 1910s, especially as radical nationalism began to grow more popular during the Weltkrieg. The Ludendorff Dictatorship would slowly find the DkP pushed aside as the demagogue and his compatriots favored the DVLP. The DkP ultimately joined alongside other parties of the Great Coalition to maintain a hold in the government, sharing the some positions with the DVLP. After the 1927 elections, Kuno von Westarp began a deep rightward shift, opening light association with the Pan-German League and various rural movements in order to keep the party competitive against both the DVLP and the Zentrum. Currently, the DkP represents Junkers, most rural farmers, and the average German conservative.§!"
GER_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "DVLP"
GER_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Deutsche Vaterlandspartei\n§LGerman Fatherland Party§!\n§gFounded in 1917, the DVLP had its origin in the jingoism of the wartime German Empire, especially due to the influence of its founder Erich Ludendorff. It was with him that the party would enjoy the height of its power, functionally controlling the whole of the German Empire. However, the general's rule would not last, and his ignominious removal from power and scapegoating by the rest of the German right had sent the DVLP into a freefall. While the group has had to evolve much in the wake of Ludendorff's fall and its Great Coalition-era management under Alfred von Tirpitz, the platform's core has remained mostly same. Hoping to wield Empire's state organs for the 'righteous cause', the DVLP is known for reactionary monarchism, desire for pre-eminence of the military, and its far-right leanings in both economics and political orientation. The connection to Völkisch groups such as the Pan-German League, as well as the recent leadership of the party under Alfred Hugenberg, has thus far paid off in keeping the DVLP existent.§!"
GER_national_populist_party:0 "DF"
GER_national_populist_party_long:0 "Deutsche Fraktion\n§LGerman Faction§!\n§gThe DF is less of a party and instead more of a catch-all term for the various influential far-right nationalist groups that wield influence in the Empire one way or another, with a figurehead leader and foremost speaker in the form of Moeller van den Bruck. While seen as the origin point of the growingly powerful anti-parliamentary and illiberal 'Young Conservative' movement, he mostly exercises behind-the-scenes power incorporating influential figures within the arms of disparate political clubs beneath his influence. However, even with Moeller as the principle 'leader' of the DF, the movement's rhetoric changes intensively between its constituent groups. The DF's fractious nature has made it incapable of manifesting much in the way of electoral victory. This diversity is seen within its alignment of smaller parties such as the German People's Party, Christian Social Party, and sections of the Free Conservative Party.§!"

While in the aftermath of the Weltkrieg and the Tirpitz years the union had remained mostly sequestered only within the borders of Europe, the rising role of Germany in world affairs has had many consider if it should extend its reach beyond just the neighbors of the Heimat.\n\nThe regions of the world are full of opportunities for investment, and European bureaucrats have already divided the land to ensure ease for the Kaiser in signing off on the varied available projects. If the German Empire hopes to improve its industrial might, or pull more of the globe beneath its wing, then it shall need to learn the nuances of soft power.\n\n§GWhen you make specific investments in other countries, you will raise your Investment Level. You can spend your Investment Level on improving the Strength of Mitteleuropa for either yourself or others. Investment Decisions that will give you a higher Investment Level will note as much.§!"

The AVA has received plenty of designs from the Empire's many aeronautical companies, a substantial amount coming from Willy Messerschmitt, and most are seeking to make use of the promise inherent to the jet engine.

While the exact gains to be had with these more mysterious, often dangerous, ventures are unknown, they claim to be capable of constructing weaponry that could change the very face of war itself. As Braun designs rockets capable of incinerating more than a bomber ever could and Heisenberg seems poised to unlock the power of the atom, the world may soon be forever changed by what is discovered by these Meisters des Krieges."

Their destinies aren't theirs to wield, for they would surely march themselves into desolation the likes of which the Balkan peninsula wrought upon itself.\n\nThis cannot be, for all nations of Mitteleuropa must learn that the German Order is the German Law.

Perhaps our reckless attitude could ultimately result in a collapse so often seen in the empires of yore. If we are to rule the continent in the years to come, we have to take a lighter approach as opposed to simply reaping all the rewards ourselves.\n\nAs Mitteleuropa grows ever prosperous, we'll work to make sure that the benefits of economic growth go back to fraternal nations as a whole rather than filling our coffers. We shall also grant more initiative to Mitteleuropa's member states when it comes to the rigidity of project planning. These states must now only adhere to goals rather than a direct plan, which should give them at least the illusion of choice. Lastly, the budgets of reconstructing our less fortunate neighbours shall be expanded to cement our role as Europe's first among equals.\n\nAll of our actions together will steadily show that Mitteleuropa is not just a flock of sheep led by the German lion, but rather a true union of nations standing together for a common ideal of a Europe of Nations.

There is, of course, nothing wrong with allowing the people a voice, after all every long-standing empire has given their constituents the means to govern. Yet the talks of reforming the class system or even permitting women to vote will only bring unwanted chaos to our state. It would be best, as has been shown time and time again with the workers growing ever more radical, to enact Prussia's three-class franchise across the whole of the Empire.\n\nThis will undoubtedly provoke revolt in Bavaria and the Rhineland, both regions already resisting Prussianist dogma with a bitter hatred, but in the interests of making sure only the proper people have a say in our government we must do whatever is necessary. The world is growing more violent, we can't leave our fate to an unrestricted ballot."

### Domestic Events ###

gerdom.1.t:0 "The Ascension of the Adler"
gerdom.1.d:0 "The Weltkrieg, that great and terrible war which forced the rising German Empire into confrontation with virtually all of its neighbors, had concluded with an undeniable German victory. The old rivals of Russia, France, and the United Kingdom were all left defeated and bloodied, more than a few falling to revolution, but this vindication of German supremacy did not come without its cost or insidious opportunists willing to abuse it. The Kaiser, who had angered the militarists Paul Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff through his refusal to enact unrestricted submarine warfare during the war, slowly saw his own power sapped from him as these titans of the OHL formed a de facto military junta.\n\nThe dictatorship's true founding moment would be in the November Uprisings of 1918, which saw the Spartacist League lead a mass wave of worker discontent against the regime, inspired by their red comrades in Russia and the simmering discontent of France. The millions of lives lost in the Weltkrieg shackled the populace to the fear of a nightmare where this hard-fought victory could all be lost in the flash of an eye. In this cursed world of strife, the people surrendered towards the whims of Hindenburg and Ludendorff, who formed the DVLP alongside Wolfgang Kapp and Alfred von Tirpitz to add political legitimacy to their nascent autocracy. The uprisings were crushed, and an intervention in Russia snuffed out the Bolshevik flame before it could turn Europe to naught but ashes, but further pre-emptive war against France was prevented by one Kurt von Schleicher, then Reichskommissar for Nancy, ordering his units to focus on internal dissent instead.\n\nThis rift in the Deutsches Heer's direction steadily ballooned until Ludendorff was unable to demand more conflict, and the war machine of the Empire finally began to slow down. The Kaiser himself took note, and the close call was an impetus for Tirpitz's distancing from the regime..."
gerdom.1.a:0 "Peace bought by blood."

gerdom.1001.t:0 "The Tirpitz 'Golden Years'"
gerdom.1001.d:0 "While the first post-war election in 1922 saw a massive surge of support for the DVLP, the lack of a decisive battle against France and the leeway given to the remainder of Germany's enemies already set a slow build-up of civil discontent against the OHL dictatorship in motion. This discontent exploded as Erich Ludendorff was implicated in a scandal rife with corruption and blatant autocracy, a wealth of private communique and deals with Junker estates revealed by unknown private sources. Kaiser Wilhelm II, already chafing at the fact that his empire was run by someone other than himself, took the opportunity to officially demand Ludendorff's resignation as general, and Ludendorff's allies Alfred von Tirpitz, Wolfgang Kapp, and even Paul Hindenburg had all abandoned him to his fate. The former dictator retired and had unofficially quit politics, while Tirpitz was left to pick up what remained of the DVLP when the other main leaders had decided to enjoy the spoils of victory in a more graceful retirement.\n\nAlfred von Tirpitz's governance of the Empire oversaw the creation of the 'Grand Coalition', a successful attempt to shift many party platforms towards the right wing, and the best years the German economy had ever seen in growth and wealth. It was easy for Tirpitz, viewed as a true representative of all sectors of the Empire's interests, to maintain control up until his death in 1930, the resulting vacuum leaving the DVLP headless and sending German politics into chaos. The elections in 1932 would see a DkP-Zentrum coalition easily take hold, painting itself as a choice of stability in uncertain times.\n\nKuno von Westarp, the new Reichskanzler, now stands as the head of such a coalition, yet the years of his tenure have been unkind. The powers surrounding Germany are once more sharpening their swords, and the costs of economic isolation are finally showing their ugly faces. The 'boom' of Tirpitz's reign seems poised to collapse just as the world turns towards conflict once more, but the German people have weathered many tests that would have broken weaker nations. Come what may, the Empire will stand forever!"

gerdom.1002.t:0 "The Constitution of the German Kaiserreich" #MINOR REWRITE NEEDED
gerdom.1002.d:0 "After the crushing defeat of the Second French Empire by forces of the North German Federation, our constitution was signed in 1871 by representatives of the Federation and four other states in southern Germany. The new constitutional framework created integrated the southern states into the Prussian-led Federation, thus giving the enlarged entity a new identity as the Deutsches Reich.\n\nAccording to the constitution, the Empire is a federation of twenty-five German states. The title of Bundespräsidium, or Federation President, was held by the King of Prussia, a figure now invested with the title of Emperor of Germany. The Emperor directly appoints the Chancellor, the head of government and chairman of the Bundesrat, the council of representatives of the German states. Laws are enacted by both the Bundesrat and the Reichstag, the lower house Imperial Diet elected by male Germans above the age of 25 years.\n\nWith an option to dissolve the Reichstag on a whim, it is clear that the main political power in the German Empire actually rests not in Reichstag, elected by the people, but in the hands of the non-elected German Emperor. Another issue is the Prussian three-class voting system, which has remained mostly unchanged since 1849.\n\nOver sixty years after the founding of the Kaiserreich, the liberals and social democrats are growing increasingly disgruntled with the status quo and our constitution may need revision soon to help us weather the upcoming turbulence..."

gerdom.11.t:0 "Agricultural Crisis in Mitteleuropa"
gerdom.11.d:0 "During this time of great crisis, the complacent agricultural sector of the German economy has proven to be particularly vulnerable to the economic downturn. With this in mind several Junkers, representing the landed nobility of the Kingdom of Prussia, have asked for protectionist legislation and state subsidies for their agricultural production. By imposing tariffs on foreign produce, we will strengthen this vital sector of the Reich's economy and protect our farmers. Unfortunately such a measure is likely to cause further damage to the economy of our neighbours, dependent as they are on German markets for their food exports. The wheat crop in the Ukraine is particularly vulnerable, and choosing to enact protectionist measures might seriously damage them and our other agrarian partners."

gerdom.12.t:0 "Suffragist Movement Gathers Strength"
gerdom.12.d:0 "Lately there has been increased momentum in the women's suffrage movement, which seeks to force the government to enfranchise women by giving them the right to vote and stand for elected office. In these troubled times for the Empire, we must be careful in formulating a policy response liable to cause domestic tensions. Granting the suffragists what they ask would anger the more conservative elements of our government, particularly members of the Reichstag, a body currently elected solely by universal male suffrage. On the other hand, a stern refusal followed by reprisals may lead to further protests and riots, especially in the more liberal states, many of which already permit female voting in regional assemblies."

Their contribution has been invaluable and they have proven their ability and independence time and time again. For these reasons, the suffragist movement is stronger than ever and asking once again that the government grant women the right to vote and to run for office."

These 'Halbstarke' steal products from the markets and shops, and often money from innocent pedestrians, or commit acts of vandalism to escape boredom and frustration. Few citizens feel safe on the streets anymore and it is clear that what some in the government might see merely as low-level civic disorder instead has the makings of total societal breakdown."

Unfortunately, with our naval industry limited due to ongoing economic malaise, we will have to limit ourselves to one area of production.

## New BM Events

gerdom.17.t:0 "Flight of the Markets"
gerdom.17.d:0 "The sudden collapse of the Börse Berlin AG, one of the oldest stock exchanges in our lands dating back to 1685, has sent shockwaves that triggered widespread panic and financial turmoil. As businesses shutter their doors and unemployment skyrockets, the confidence of corporations and economists in Kuno von Westarp and his government has been severely shaken. Many industrialists and financiers are now relocating their industries and remaining capital to countries less affected by the Black Monday, mainly foreign investment havens such as Costa Rica or other major powers like Japan.\n\nThis domino effect is making the Empire's current crisis even worse, and despite appeals for calm from the Reichskanzler and Hermann Warbold, the State Secretary for Economic Affairs, it would appear that we can expect the phenomenon of capital flight from the entire Mitteleuropa to intensify in the coming weeks. Since our economy is mainly based on large conglomerates such as Siemens and Krupp, whose resources are still chiefly based in the Fatherland, we are spared from falling into total financial meltdown. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly clear that a resolute and decisive response from the cabinet will be needed as soon as possible, in spite of the political tensions and conflicts within the ruling DkP-Zentrum coalition, if we do not want to see the triumphs of yesteryears to be turned into dust."
gerdom.17.a:0 "Rats fleeing the ship, all of you!"

gerdom.18.t:0 "The Slither in the Dark"
gerdom.18.d:0 "It seems that the confusion running rampant across the entire government due to the unstable weeks is not only limited to civilian matters. Indeed, Kuno von Westarp received several reports from anonymous officers describing unusual orders given by General Kurt von Schleicher outside the usual chain of command of the Deutsches Heer. It would appear that Schleicher and his loyal followers within the Abwehr are abusing their military ranks to prevent the flight of capital out of the Empire and Mitteleuropa through intimidation and bribes. What is more, officers unrepentant in their opposition to General Schleicher have recently tendered their resignations or asked to be relocated to posts in Afrika and Ostasien.\n\nWorst of all, there are even rumors that Kurt von Schleicher and the Kaiser himself met in secret, without informing the Westarp cabinet, the Bundesrat or the Reichtag. Having neither tangible proof nor knowledge of the possible outcome, the Reichskanzler is forced into inaction, but if these rumors would be proven true it might spell out disaster for the Reichskanzler. In such a scenario, the Kaiser has already lost confidence in the current government and already plans on appointing a man 'more capable' of leading the Fatherland..."
gerdom.18.a:0 "Another Ludendorff, or something more?"

gerdom.19.t:0 "Mass Veteran's March in Berlin"
gerdom.19.d:0 "One of the sectors which unfortunately suffered the most from the Black Monday was military pensions. Many of our patriotic and accomplished Weltkrieg veterans are forced to count on their pensions to survive, having been left unable to find any job providing a decent wage. Whether it is due to major psychological trauma from the horrors of war or physical injuries, ranging from amputation of limbs to almost complete invalidity, these proud sons of the Fatherland are thus dependant on the state. Understandably, the boiling discontent with the system they have fought so hard to preserve has only grown with the reduction in the amounts of pensions they received, a tragic measure we had to take in order to reduce our expenses and hopefully survive the crisis.\n\nSeveral veterans' associations from across the Empire, such as Theodor Duesterberg's faction within Der Stahlhelm fanned by his benefactor Hugenberg or Der Wehrwolf and its enigmatic leader Fritz Kloppe, have organized an enormous march in the imperial capital of Berlin, denouncing what they perceive as an abandonment of the most devoted and courageous sons by the Kaiser and his government. Faced with demands of a return to the pre-1936 pensions, and even their considerable increase, our government is obviously incapable of responding to the veterans at the moment. Ultimately, this march marks another blow to the precarious stability of Kuno von Westarp's DkP-Zentrum coalition."
gerdom.19.a:0 "Can we not even repay our old heroes anymore?"

gerdom.20.t:0 "DkP Crippled by Infighting"
gerdom.20.d:0 "As much as the dominant party of the ruling coalition may hold the interests of Germany and its people as a priority, it does not guard them from intense and bitter factionalism so characteristic of recent Imperial politics. Indeed, despite the support base of the DkP being traditionally Junkers, predominantly the ones holding grand estates in Eastern Germany, the economic calamity drove a sizeable and vocal conservative minority to criticize the status quo inherited from the party's history. They claim that in the face of the great challenges strangling Germany's most vulnerable, poor farmers and rural workers, the DkP ought to turn their attention to them lest they fall victim to Socialist agitation.\n\nThis tendency is represented by the Christian-National Peasants' and Farmers' Party, or simply the CNBL, which continues to grow in popularity among conservatives. Despite Reichskanzler Kuno von Westarp's best efforts to navigate the rivers of factionalism within his party the hard task of maintaining a semblance of stability in the post-Tirpitz political camp has so far turned out mostly fruitless. It remains to be seen if the divisions that are damaging the DkP will shatter their chances of receiving the support of the German electorate once again."

gerdom.55.a:0 "We must help them!"
gerdom.55.b:0 "We are not ready for this."

gerdom.56.t:0 "General Strike in the Rhineland!"
gerdom.56.d:0 "Angered by our previous actions aimed against labour fronts the workers have launched massive demonstrations throughout the Rhineland. A major police station in Mainz was burned down in a suspected arson attack and a shell factory near Landau smashed up by angry workers. These demonstrations are seriously undermining our military production and endangering the stability of our most important industrial region."
gerdom.56.a:0 "Send in the army to deal with the strike!"
gerdom.56.b:0 "Negotiate with the workers."

gerdom.57.t:0 "Rhenish Strikers Cave!"
gerdom.57.d:0 "The slow war of attrition between us and the strikers has been won by the government. The strikers, seeing little success in their efforts, have decided to call off the strike."
gerdom.57.a:0 "Great!"

gerdom.58.t:0 "Rhineland Strike Negotiations"
gerdom.58.d:0 "An attempt to negotiate with the striking workers has been made. With all major political groups in the country closely watch the meeting, some are even hoping that the strike will set a precedent for further reforms in the Empire."

gerdom.60.d:0 "Thankfully, our armed forces were able to suppress the revolting workers, forcing them to abandon their hopeless struggle."
gerdom.60.a:0 "Splendid!"

gerdom.61.t:0 "Syndicalist Involvement in the General Strike"
gerdom.61.d:0 "Although the general strike in the Rhineland is finally over an official inquiry into the event has suggested that a number of rebellious workers were supplied from abroad. Agitators, likely French Communards, handed out military-grade equipment and distributed Syndicalist propaganda to the masses. How should we react to this insolence?"
gerdom.61.a:0 "We cannot tolerate such insolence!"
gerdom.61.b:0 "We need solid proof of Syndicalist involvement."

gerdom.63.t:0 "Wilhelm Groener Dies"

gerdom.65.t:0 "Wilhelm Souchon Dies"
gerdom.65.d:0 "Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, a hero of the Weltkrieg and a Großadmiral in both our fleet and the Ottoman fleet, has passed away today.

gerdom.66.t:0 "Georg Bruchmüller Dies"
gerdom.66.d:0 "Feldmarschall Bruchmüller a hero of the Weltkrieg and key developer of modern artillery tactics, has passed away today. Known to all as 'Breakthrough Müller' for his decisive actions during campaigns on both the Western and Eastern fronts, he will surely be missed by all Germans."

### The Kaiserbund ###

gerdom.72.t:0 "Status of Indonesia"
gerdom.72.d:0 "As part of our Kaiserbund programme we have decided to make our Indonesian holdings a semi-autonomous state in our empire. How would we like to divide the lands?"
gerdom.72.a:0 "Create a pan-Malayan state."
gerdom.72.b:0 "Divide the lands between Sarawak and Malaysia."

gerdom.73.t:0 "Status of Indochina"

gerdom.73.a:0 "Create a pan-Indochinese state."
gerdom.73.b:0 "Divide it into states."

gerdom.74.t:0 "The Division of Mittelafrika"
gerdom.74.d:0 "As part of our new Kaiserbund policy it is incumbent on us to issue directions as new administrative arrangements in our colonies. One such territory is Mittelafrika. While conservative members of Reichstag are eager to leave the autonomous state unmolested, the bulk of our political establishment have already realised that Freistaat of Mittelafrika acts as a burden for both the German armed forces and our economy. Among the limited benefits the colony offers us is imperial prestige, and even then the Dark Continent is no longer seen in the same light as during Scramble for Afrika. Therefore, drastic reorganisation of this area is needed if we want to retain our presence in Afrika with while limiting our costs as much as possible."
gerdom.74.a:0 "Divide Mittelafrika into states."
gerdom.74.b:0 "Federalise them."
gerdom.74.c:0 "Keep the status quo."

gerdom.75.t:0 "Status of Malta"
gerdom.75.d:0 "With our new Kaiserbund policy currently being instituted by all limbs of the German state, the gaze of our officials has reached the Mediterranean island of Malta. Almost all important members of the general staff and many conservative politicians are arguing for keeping this island under direct control. They argue that Malta is crucial for the security of our Mediterranean shipping lanes between Marokko and the Suez, and point to its function as an 'unsinkable aircraft carrier'."
gerdom.75.a:0 "Grant them limited autonomy."
gerdom.75.b:0 "Keep them under our direct control."

#gerdom.76.t:0 "Status of Somaliland"
#gerdom.76.d:0 "With our decision to implement Kaiserbund programme we still have to decide extent of its implementation on various fringe regions under our control. One such region is the German Somaliland. While admirals of Kaiserliche Marine are arguing for keeping this territory under our direct control as a way to keep Gulf of Aden under our control, the most of politicians would rather cut down our expenses with administration of this territory even at cost of diminishing our presence in this area."

gerdom.77.t:0 "The Reorganisation of Mittelafrika"
gerdom.77.d:0 "We will have to reorganise our internal structure in accordance with the new orders from Germany..."
gerdom.77.a:0 "A new order for Africa!"
gerdom.77.b:0 "Oh, I don't think so."

gerdom.78.t:0 "The Reorganisation of Mittelafrika"
gerdom.78.d:0 "We will have to reorganise our internal structure in accordance with the new orders from Germany..."
gerdom.78.a:0 "A new order for Africa!"
gerdom.78.b:0 "Oh, I don't think so."

gerdom.81.t:0 "Status of Aden"
gerdom.81.d:0 "With our decision to implement the Kaiserbund programme we still have to decide the extent of its implementation in various fringe regions under our control. One such region is Aden in the Yemen. While admirals of Kaiserliche Marine are arguing for keeping this territory under our direct control as a way to keep the Gulf of Aden under our control, most politicians would rather cut down on our administrative expenses even at the cost of diminishing our presence in the region."
gerdom.81.a:0 "Grant them limited autonomy."
gerdom.81.b:0 "Offer Aden to Yemen."
gerdom.81.c:0 "Keep them under our direct control."

gerdom.82.t:0 "Germany Offers Us Aden"
gerdom.82.d:0 "The Germans have sent us an offer in which they will secede us the Aden and in return we become their protectorate. The offer is tempting to say the least, should we accept it?"
gerdom.82.a:0 "Accept the offer!"
gerdom.82.b:0 "We refuse!"

gerdom.83.t:0 "Yemen Accepted"
gerdom.83.d:0 "The Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen has agreed to our offer and they have become our protectorate."
gerdom.83.a:0 "Great!"

gerdom.84.t:0 "Coronation of Wilhelm III"
gerdom.84.d:0 "With the passing of the great Weltkriegskaiser Wilhelm II, Wilhelm III has given a grand speech on his coronation day to guide all of Germany towards prosperity and to safeguard our interests across the globe!"
gerdom.84.a:0 "Heil dir im Siegerkranz!"

gerdom.85.t:0 "Germany Bans French Organisations!"
gerdom.85.d:0 "In response to the increasing self-assurance and revolutionary spirit of the Commune, the pathetic German leadership has instituted a harsh policy of cracking down on any organisations funded by us or related to French culture or politics in any manner. These discriminatory actions aimed against the struggling French minority within Germany, particularly in our occupied regions of Nancy and Alsace, are absolutely intolerable."
gerdom.85.a:0 "This shall not stand. To war!"
gerdom.85.b:0 "Assist French resistance groups."
gerdom.85.c:0 "Publicly condemn German actions."
gerdom.85.e:0 "We should avoid entanglements at this stage."

gerdom.86.t:0 "International Condemnation of Our Ban!"
gerdom.86.d:0 "The Commune of France used our recent actions aimed against all French organisations within the German Empire to organise an international conference on the issue. They publicly condemned what they call 'German Imperialism' and pledged to do everything possible to protect the French minority within the Reich. In response, several important members of the international community similarly condemned our actions against the French population, stating that such actions are a stain on the honour of a modern state. How should we react to this public humiliation?"
gerdom.86.a:0 "The Communards are behind this, destroy them!"
gerdom.86.b:0 "Germany cares not for the protests of minnows."
gerdom.86.c:0 "Restore the rights of the French minority."

gerdom.91.t:0 "German Mission Arrives in Don-Kuban"
gerdom.91.d:0 "The German Empire decided to send an official military mission to our homeland in order to help us improve our obsolete armed forces. Such missions are well regarded for their impact on the militaries of nations like Ukraine and Venezuela, and we are fortunate to have them."
gerdom.91.a:0 "We will show them Cossack hospitality!"

gerdom.92.t:0 "Lettow-Vorbeck and the Flame of German Resistance"
gerdom.92.d:0 "This is the darkest hour of the German Empire. Defeated by the planes, tanks and tactics of a brutal foe, the imperial government has evacuated Berlin and is currently converging, shell-shocked and battered, on Daressalam. However, the army is not Germany itself, and under the African skies our loyal colonies remain committed to the war effort. All the same, the Reich's government as it stands is facing loathing for presiding over the greatest military catastrophe in German history, and many senior army officers are demanding the appointment of a new emergency chancellor. Many of them are clamouring for Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck to be elevated to this position, given his successes in Afrika during the Weltkrieg and the loyalty and affection that he commands among the askaris we must now rely on."
gerdom.92.a:0 "Yes! Appoint von Lettow-Vorbeck! Heia Safari!"
gerdom.92.b:0 "No! This would be the last nail in the coffin of our democracy!"

gerdom.93.t:0 "Lettow-Vorbeck Proposes an 'Afrikakorps'"
gerdom.93.d:0 "Chancellor von Lettow-Vorbeck has stood before the emergency government and argued that the German state must raise additional units of native schutztruppen, also known as askaris. These doughty soldiers have served the Reich faithfully ever since the chancellor outwitted the Entente in the jungles of Ostafrika during the Weltkrieg. Controversially, von Lettow-Vorbeck has also proposed that we grant the native kings, princes and vassals that rule Afrika in our stead complete independence once we retake our Vaterland. Such a reward would incentivise our native population and leaders and invigorate them to assist us in getting to Berlin. This is a desperate proposal, but the Reich is going through desperate times."
gerdom.93.a:0 "Rally the askaris from all of Mittelafrika!"
gerdom.93.b:0 "Pointless. We need German troops for a German war!"

gerdom.94.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Südwestafrika"
gerdom.94.d:0 "One of the first German colonies, Südwestafrika has proven especially loyal to the imperial government. However, its close connection with the founding of the German colonial empire might make it difficult for conservatives within our cabinet to accept the prospect of independence that has promised by von Lettow-Vorbeck."
gerdom.94.a:0 "Excellent."

gerdom.95.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Deutsch-Ostafrika"
gerdom.95.d:0 "The site of some of the most impressive battles fought by the German colonial army under von Lettow-Vorbeck during the Weltkrieg, Ostafrika, with its capital of Daressalam, is seen by most officials as the jewel in the crown of the Reich's African possessions. As such the German administration is deeply entrenched here and cooperation with the natives run smoothly, resulting in a large turnout of volunteers for the new Schutztruppen."

gerdom.96.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Deutsch-Kongo"
gerdom.96.d:0 "Taken from the defeated Belgian state after the Weltkrieg, the Congo occupies the heart of Central Africa and has for decades of German administration been heavily militarised to secure the Reich's control over the province."

gerdom.97.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Äquatorialafrika"
gerdom.97.d:0 "Strategically located to the immediate south of the Sahara, the colony of German Equatorial Africa employs some of the most impressive auxiliary troops, most of which have spent years fighting nomadic raiders on the border."

gerdom.98.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Niger-Kamerun"
gerdom.98.d:0 "One of the more recently acquired African provinces, Niger was merged with the German colony of Kamerun in the Mittelafrikan state. Though somewhat disunited, the natives stand ready to earn their independence in the pay of the Reich!"

gerdom.99.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Togoland"
gerdom.99.d:0 "Consisting of the original German colony of Togo and the annexed British and French colonies of the Gold Coast and Dahomey, the askaris formed here are of a notably lesser quality than seen elsewhere in Mittelafrika. All the same, they stand ready to assist Germany in its hour of need - for the right price."

gerdom.100.t:0 "Decolonisation of Afrika"
gerdom.100.d:0 "In the darkest hour of the German Empire, Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck rallied the colonial askaris behind the Reich by promising them independence once the war had been won. Our enemies have been crushed and Berlin liberated, leading to many of our African subjects humbly asking us to uphold our promises and commence the decolonisation of our domains in Africa."
gerdom.100.a:0 "We shall uphold our promises."
gerdom.100.b:0 "Afrika shall remain German forever more!"

### Security ###

gerdom.105.t:0 "Germany Suppresses its French Population!"
gerdom.105.d:0 "The German Empire, afraid of the rising power of our state decided to tighten control of the border regions, since they are fearful of our growing influence! We must be patient, soon the time will come, when our brothers in Wallonia, Lorraine and Alsace shall be liberated!"
gerdom.105.a:0 "Soon, our time shall come!"

gerdom.106.t:0 "Further Internal Security Measures"
gerdom.106.d:0 "Despite the gradual increase of military and police presence in our border region, it is still not enough. Underground French Syndicalist leaders are still on loose, poisoning the minds of our French minority with propaganda, with many using existing French organisations as cover for their vile acts. In order to fully secure our territorial integrity, right-wing members of our government have demanded the complete dissolution of all French or French funded organisations. However, even if such drastic step may seem necessary, it will undoubtedly damage our reputation in the international community..."
gerdom.106.a:0 "Current security measures are sufficient!"
gerdom.106.b:0 "It's time to ban all French organisations in Germany!"
gerdom.106.c:0 "This plan was madness from the beginning, abandon it..."

### Rhenish Syndicalist Volunteers ###

gerdom.200.t:0 "Bertolt Brecht Requests Visa"
gerdom.200.d:0 "For some time now, Syndicalist sympathisers from the Rhineland have been going abroad to help their 'comrades' in their various conflicts around the world. Today, the famous underground writer Bertolt Brecht has announced his intent to join these 'International Divisions'.\n\nWe could let him go, which would most likely inspire quite a number of other Syndicalists to go abroad after him, or we could confiscate his passport and prohibit him from leaving the country. As Brecht is a prominent figure, blocking him could perhaps weaken the Syndicalist cause, but on the other hand it would likely cause tremendous outrage..."
gerdom.200.aa:0 "Let him go to wild America."
gerdom.200.ab:0 "He can go to Brazil if he wants."
gerdom.200.ac:0 "He can go to Brazil if he wants."
gerdom.200.ad:0 "Let's hope he freezes in Russia."
gerdom.200.ae:0 "He can sweat in Spain."
gerdom.200.af:0 "We should keep him where we can watch him."

gerdom.201.t:0 "German Volunteers Arrive in America"
gerdom.201.d:0 "Two German volunteer divisions, headed by the writer Bertolt Brecht and other figures of the German Syndicalist scene, have arrived to support us in our struggle!"
gerdom.201.a:0 "Die Internationale erkämpft das Menschenrecht!"

gerdom.202.t:0 "German Volunteers Arrive in Brazil"
gerdom.202.d:0 "Two German volunteer divisions, headed by the writer Bertolt Brecht and other figures of the German Syndicalist scene, have arrived to support us in our struggle!"
gerdom.202.a:0 "Die Internationale erkämpft das Menschenrecht!"

gerdom.203.t:0 "German Volunteers Arrive in Russia"
gerdom.203.d:0 "Two German volunteer divisions, headed by the writer Bertolt Brecht and other figures of the German Syndicalist scene, have arrived to support us in our struggle!"
gerdom.203.a:0 "Die Internationale erkämpft das Menschenrecht!"

gerdom.204.t:0 "German Volunteers Arrive in Spain"
gerdom.204.d:0 "Two German volunteer divisions, headed by the writer Bertolt Brecht and other figures of the German Syndicalist scene, have arrived to support us in our struggle!"
gerdom.204.a:0 "Die Internationale erkämpft das Menschenrecht!"

gerdom.205.t:0 "Calm in the Rhineland"
gerdom.205.d:0 "With a number of prominent Syndicalists out of the country and allowed to fight, and hopefully die, in foreign lands, tensions in our lands have decreased greatly without their malign influence. The Rhineland is finally seeing some peace and quiet."
gerdom.205.a:0 "Let's hope things stay this way."

gerdom.206.t:0 "Policy on Returning Syndicalists"
gerdom.206.d:0 "Now that their war has been lost, the 'International Divisions' formed from our volunteers are trying to return to their homes. Many still have their arms and all survivors are battle-hardened, indoctrinated Syndicalists. However, if we prohibit them from entering over our borders, we should be able to keep them away without much of a scandal due to the hardening of the German population's views on the Red Menace. Still, we might risk them turning against us when we inevitably come to blows with the Internationale."
gerdom.206.a:0 "They'll have to serve their term in the Heer!"
gerdom.206.b:0 "Let them return to their families."
gerdom.206.c:0 "Close the borders!"

gerdom.207.t:0 "Bertolt Brecht Dies in Suspicious Circumstances"
gerdom.207.d:0 "Though rumours have been spreading for weeks, we now have official confirmation; Syndicalist writer Bertolt Brecht has died in some rotten cellar, most likely at the hands of foreign police. After serving abroad as Syndicalist volunteer, Brecht was blocked from re-entering Germany.\n\nHis family, together with other Syndicalist elements, staged scale demonstrations in Berlin, blaming our hardline policy towards Syndicalist volunteers for his death."
gerdom.207.a:0 "It seems that we have created a martyr."

gerdom.208.t:0 "Bertolt Brecht Returns to Germany"
gerdom.208.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, it seems like the Syndicalist writer Bertolt Brecht has somehow managed to smuggle himself over the border. He and his family have gone underground and the controversial figure is openly preaching for solidarity by the workers against the capitalist system."
gerdom.208.a:0 "Can't he ever shut up?!"

gerdom.209.t:0 "International Divisions Offer Their Service"
gerdom.209.d:0 "After valiantly fighting for the Syndicalist cause, the comrades and veterans of the International Divisions have cowardly been denied entrance to their own homeland in Germany. After months of drifting, many of the former members have now reassembled and decided to take up arms to liberate Germany from the scourge of imperialism. While their numbers have been reduced by fighting and poverty, they are battle-hardened veterans and would make a worthy addition to the forces of the Internationale."
gerdom.209.a:0 "Welcome comrades!"
gerdom.209.b:0 "A needless expense."

gerdom.211.t:0 "Pick-A-Flag"
gerdom.211.d:0 "Welcome to the German Flag Shop, pick your flavour!"
gerdom.211.a:0 "I'll take the classic Reichskriegsflagge."

### Foreign Events ###

gerfor.1.t:0 "Union of Britain Attacks Denmark"
gerfor.1.d:0 "The Union of Britain has declared war on Denmark. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in favour of the Internationale, and the Danish government has asked for our help. Shall we warn the Syndicalists about the foolishness of their actions or say nothing, and risk losing Denmark?"
gerfor.1.a:0 "Warn them to turn back or face German arms!"
gerfor.1.b:0 "We have enough problems to be dealing with."

gerfor.2.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum Over Denmark"
gerfor.2.d:0 "The Second Reich has sent an ultimatum to London. We are to either make peace with Denmark and declare a ceasefire or Germany will come to Denmark's aid. Though it is certainly in our interests to seize the Skagerrak and pose a dangerous threat to Germany on its northern border, calling their bluff may prove to be extremely risky."
gerfor.2.a:0 "We will not risk war with Germany over this."
gerfor.2.b:0 "We do not negotiate with imperialists."

gerfor.3.t:0 "German Assistance Against Britain"
gerfor.3.d:0 "We are in a state of war with the Union of Britain. Our military, while proud, will not be able to withstand the Syndicalist onslaught. Some influential figures are petitioning us to ask the Germans for help, even if it might mean having to accept some German influence after the invasion is repelled. What shall we do?"
gerfor.3.a:0 "Thank you Berlin!"
gerfor.3.b:0 "The Germans cannot be trusted."

gerfor.4.t:0 "Union of Britain Backs Down"
gerfor.4.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders on the ground to cease fire and return to the British Isles. We have achieved a diplomatic victory today. We have shown the world that we will stand up to Socialist and Syndicalist aggression. We will protect any nation under threat from Britain or the Commune."

gerfor.6.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders ordering an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal to British territory. Denmark's independence has been preserved and our pride left intact. All the same, the fact that it took German intervention to protect us is somewhat unsettling."
gerfor.6.a:0 "We couldn't have done it without them."

gerfor.7.t:0 "Internationale Seeks to Reunify Italy"
gerfor.7.d:0 "The combined forces of the French Commune and the Socialist Republic of Italy have launched an attempt to seize the entirety of Italy. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in Europe in favour of the Syndicalists. Shall we warn the Internationale that this threatens world peace or let the peninsula fall to their malignant ideology?"

gerfor.8.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum Over Italy"
gerfor.8.d:0 "The German Empire has sent us a telegram, demanding that either we end our intervention in Italy and declare a ceasefire with the Italian states or the Reich will intervene by force."

gerfor.9.t:0 "Germany Sends the Internationale an Ultimatum"
gerfor.9.d:0 "The Kaiserreich has come to our aid! They have sent an ultimatum to the Commune of France over their support for the Socialist Republic of Italy in its attempts to conquer the entire peninsula. The Germans demand that the Syndicalists fall back or risk utter annihilation."

gerfor.10.t:0 "Commune of France Withdraws from Italy"
gerfor.10.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by Paris, they quickly withdrew their forces from the frontlines and abandoned the peninsula. Our independence will be preserved, and our pride left intact."
gerfor.10.d.sri:0 "Drawing [FRA.GetNameDef] into our war with [ITA.GetNameDef] was perhaps not the wisest idea. The war drew the attention of the Reich which issued an ultimatum to [FRA.GetNameDef] to cease the invasion. The [FRA.GetAdjective] government has complied, ordering our own forces to stand down. We have little choice but to comply."

gerfor.11.t:0 "Commune of France Backs Down in Italy"
gerfor.11.d:0 "After we sent an ultimatum to the Commune of France to cease their intervention in Italy and backing for the Italian Syndicalists in the war, they wisely decided to comply. Already Red forces are withdrawing and our prestige has been greatly heightened. Yet again we have used diplomacy to help guard the balance, and improve prospects for European peace."

gerfor.12.t:0 "Commune of France Ignores Italian Ultimatum"
gerfor.12.d:0 "Our ultimatum was flatly ignored. Already SRI and Communard forces are on the march in Italy and refusing to return to their pre-war boundaries. The other states of the Italian peninsula are threatened existentially and Syndicalism is poised to spread its vile ideology to every corner of the land. The issue now is, do we back up our ultimatum with force and declare war on the Internationale?"

gerfor.13.t:0 "Commune of France Invades Spain"
gerfor.13.d:0 "The armed forces of the Commune of France have launched an invasion of the Spanish state. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in favour of the syndicalist alliance. Shall we warn the syndicalists about the foolishness of their actions or let Spain fall?"

gerfor.14.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Spain"
gerfor.14.d:0 "Monarchies are as thick as thieves. After we began our campaign against the Spanish kingdom we received a message from Berlin ordering us to cease and desist in our military efforts. They claim that if we do not bring our forces back beyond the Pyrenees they will intervene militarily to preserve the current status quo."

gerfor.16.t:0 "Commune of France Backs Down in Spain"
gerfor.16.d:0 "The Germans have achieved a significant diplomatic coup today, and helped preserve our independence. After the Reich sent an ultimatum to the Commune of France ordering them to cease their military aggression towards us, the French wisely decided to comply and brought their troops back from beyond the Pyrenees. The status quo remains, for now at least, intact."

gerfor.17.t:0 "Commune of France Ignores Spanish Ultimatum"
gerfor.17.d:0 "Despite our public condemnation of the Communard invasion of the Spanish Kingdom and subsequent ultimatum, the French have refused to pull their forces back. The possibility of the loss of yet another European monarchy can no longer be discounted, and the choice is now incumbent on us to decide how we should respond to this flagrant dismissal of German hegemony."

gerfor.24.t:0 "Enemy at the Gates"
gerfor.24.d:0 "The Russians have reached the Oder. There has been little outright panicking in Berlin but it is clear that without a counter-attack Germany is greatly endangered.

gerfor.25.t:0 "Die Wacht am Rhein"
gerfor.25.d:0 "The French have reached the Rhine. Our substantial border fortifications were seemingly unable to stop their inexorable advance and now our crucial industrial cities are falling one after another. The situation is quite dire, and already there are treasonous murmurings that the Communards could reach Berlin itself."
gerfor.25.a:0 "They must be stopped!"

gerfor.27.t:0 "Germany Occupies Spanish Morocco!"
gerfor.27.d:0 "The German Empire, in a show of absolute arrogance and disrespect towards our state, has occupied Spanish Morocco. Shockingly, their forces have even moved into Ceuta and Melilla, two cities that have been inviolable Spanish territory for many centuries."
gerfor.27.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."
gerfor.27.b:0 "Such outrage will not be tolerated!"

gerfor.28.t:0 "Logging in Madagascar"
gerfor.28.d:0 "The island of Madagascar has been under our rule for several decades and it is an untapped source of rare timbers like ebony and several varieties of rosewood. As these sources have not been exploited, several industrialists and members of the colonial government have proposed that we establish a joint-stock company with authority over the timber industry on the island. Shall we decree the establishment of such a company?"
gerfor.28.a:0 "Create a new joint-stock company."
gerfor.28.b:0 "Leave the industry alone."

gerfor.29.t:0 "Expanded Logging in Madagascar"
gerfor.29.d:0 "The joint-stock company that we established has began to show some results and our inventory of rare timber has steadily increased. However, with the mechanisation of logging, several thousand locals have been put out of work. The company has at the same time advised that we begin construction on a new timber processing plant to streamline production. If we were to fund this new project it would kill two birds with one stone, so to speak."
gerfor.29.a:0 "Create the new processing complex."
gerfor.29.b:0 "In this economy?"

gerfor.30.t:0 "New Madagascan Processing Complex"
gerfor.30.d:0 "The new timber processing complex has opened and the transformative effects on the local economy were immediate. Many workers responsible for the initial construction were retained by the company and many new workers were needed after construction was complete, dramatically increasing employment in the area. The access to rare timbers has also increased and a gala was held in Tananarive to toast the new complex's opening."
gerfor.30.a:0 "A successful colonial endeavour."

gerfor.31.t:0 "Uprising on Madagascar"
gerfor.31.d:0 "With no end in sight to the rising unemployment on Madagascar, many Malagasy locals, and especially the former loggers, have risen against us. What started as merely a local insurrection quickly spiralled into outright rebellion with an independence war brewing."
gerfor.31.a:0 "We really don't need this right now..."

gerfor.32.t:0 "A Second Peace With Honour"
gerfor.32.d:0 "With the fall of France our armed forces have unsuccessfully tried to gain control over the British Isles and decisively end the war in our favour. Unfortunately, Republican resistance has proven stronger than we previously anticipated, and attempts to launch a full-scale naval invasion have soured. We can now either continue the armed struggle or try to end this futile conflict by way of a peace treaty."
gerfor.32.a:0 "It is time for an armistice."
gerfor.32.b:0 "This will only end with German boots marching through London."

gerfor.33.t:0 "Germany Proposes a Second Peace With Honour"
gerfor.33.d:0 "Attempts from the Reichspakt to gain a foothold on our island and decisively end the war have failed miserably. Though the collapse of the Commune was a terrible blow to the Revolutionary cause, British arms have proven to be too much for Jerry to handle. Now the leadership of the German Empire is offering us a proposal - to terminate conflict between the Reichspakt and the remaining members of Internationale in exchange for mutual recognition. How shall we react?"
gerfor.33.a:0 "Survival is all we can hope for. Sign."
gerfor.33.b:0 "Another humiliation? Never again!"

gerfor.34.t:0 "Second Peace with Honour Signed"
gerfor.34.d:0 "It is finally done. Though we had hoped for the total obliteration of the Union of Britain and the end to Syndicalist influence in Europe, alas it was not to be. Instead the British wisely decided to make terms with us, signing the treaty in sight of a full German military parade. With this the bulk of the fighting is now over, and the Second Weltkrieg virtually ended in Europe."
gerfor.34.a:0 "Peace at last!"

gerfor.35.t:0 "The British Refused Peace!"
gerfor.35.d:0 "In a staggering display of British stubbornness, the Syndicalist wretches flatly denied our calls for a peace treaty. Instead of swallowing their pride and accepting the inevitable, the Republican government said that they would not have a Second Peace With Honour, and would end the war by marching through Berlin."
gerfor.35.a:0 "They will pay for this insolence."

gerfor.36.t:0 "Ethnic Conflict on Sri Lanka"
gerfor.36.d:0 "Ceylon Island is settled by Sinhalese and Tamils, who have battled for supremacy on the island for ages. With Black Monday wreaking havoc on our economy and colonial administration, disobedience from the native population is becoming intolerable. Our presence on Ceylon, crucial for its supplies of rubber, is becoming increasingly precarious."
gerfor.36.a:0 "Damn those nationalists!"

gerfor.37.t:0 "Union of Britain Invades Norway"
gerfor.37.d:0 "The Union of Britain has made the bold move of declaring war on the Norwegians, seeking to impose Syndicalism on them by force of arms. This invasion shows scant regard for German supremacy in Europe and the status quo that we have spent years maintaining. The question now is, what should our response to be this act of barbarism by the British?"

gerfor.38.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Norway"
gerfor.38.d:0 "We have received a damning telegram from the Reich. They are demanding that either we cease our invasion of Norway or face the full might of the Kaiserliche Marine. They cite the inviolability of sovereign European nations and a whole lot of guff about guarding the balance, but everyone knows that this act stems from German's desperate attempts to hold onto their hegemonic status on the continent. What should our response be?"

gerfor.39.t:0 "Germany Warns the Union of Britain over Norway"
gerfor.39.d:0 "Germany has come to our aid! They have sent an ultimatum to the Union of Britain, either fall back to their home islands or risk annihilation."

gerfor.40.t:0 "The Union of Britain Backs Down"
gerfor.40.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders on the ground to cease fire and return to the coast. We have achieved a diplomatic victory today, we have shown the world we will stand up to Socialist and Syndicalist aggression. We will protect any nation under threat from Britain or France."

gerfor.41.t:0 "Britain Ignores Our Norwegian Ultimatum"
gerfor.41.d:0 "In a display of repugnant audacity, the Union of Britain ignored our ultimatum. North Sea operations do not seem to have altered at all and the Republicans are continuing the war against Norway. We cannot risk the red tide of Syndicalism sinking its tendrils into yet another nation, particularly one important to our strategic interests. At the same time, open war with London would distract us at an inopportune time and potentially lead to the Internationale joining in."

gerfor.42.t:0 "The British Withdraw from Norway"
gerfor.42.d:0 "The Union of Britain appears to have listened to wise counsel, and ceased their operations in the North Sea. The German ultimatum appears to have scared them off, and Syndicalism stopped from claiming yet another scalp."

gerfor.43.t:0 "Treaty with Ireland"
gerfor.43.d:0 "With the Syndicalists awakening all over the world it is crucial for the Reichspakt to help potential allies whenever possible. With Irish sympathies swayed towards Germany due to our support during the War of Independence there now exists the possibility of gaining a strong foothold just under the socialists' noses by getting Ireland into the Reichspakt. We should start by offering them equipment and construction support."
gerfor.43.a:0 "Offer Ireland aid if they join the Reichspakt."

gerfor.44.t:0 "German Offers Support"
gerfor.44.d:0 "The German ambassador has approached us with an offer: if Ireland signs a treaty of association with the Reichspakt Germany will invest in our economy and military. While the benefits from this deal would be immense there are some in the government who are unwilling to rely on foreign aid."
gerfor.44.a:0 "Where do I sign?"
gerfor.44.b:0 "We are doing fine on our own."

gerfor.45.t:0 "Ireland Signs the Treaty"
gerfor.45.d:0 "The Irish have agreed to our offer. According to the treaty we are to supply industrial machines and the licences required to construct additional ones in Ireland itself. Additionally, we are obliged to construct and deliver guns, artillery pieces, and a number of aircraft and armour pieces to bolster their armed forces."
gerfor.45.a:0 "Begin the construction then!"

gerfor.46.t:0 "Ireland Refuses the Treaty"
gerfor.46.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Irish have decided to turn our offer down. Still, our obligations towards Ireland remain the same as they were before."
gerfor.46.a:0 "Oh well."

gerfor.47.t:0 "Irish Treaty Obligations"
gerfor.47.d:0 "We have finally finished preparations of all of the material ordered by the Irish as part of our treaty obligations. The goods are now ready to be delivered and we will give the convoy a military escort all the way to the Ireland."
gerfor.47.a:0 "Get it to Dublin, posthaste."

gerfor.48.t:0 "German Aid Arrives"
gerfor.48.d:0 "The guns, armour, aircraft and industrial machinery that Germany promised us as part of their treaty obligations have finally arrived. We have received a squadron each of fighters and bombers, a number of tanks as well as many artillery pieces and new German machine guns. This could be the first step in a fruitful relationship."
gerfor.48.a:0 "Great!"

gerfor.49.t:0 "Our Irish Treaty Obligations"
gerfor.49.d:0 "Unfortunately, with Ireland no longer able or willing to receive our aid the whole programme had to be aborted. Luckily, the equipment and craft already produced remain in our hands and is ready to be used."
gerfor.49.a:0 "Better than nothing."

gerfor.50.t:0 "Peace with [ENG.GetNameDef]?"
gerfor.50.d:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has negotiated a Second Peace with Honour with [ENG.GetNameDef], since it's clear the [ENG.GetAdjective] have lost their will to carry on the war.

Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, Germany treated us rather shabbily when it came to the Brest-Litovsk divisions, with Poland and Ukraine being forced from our sphere of influence by the glory-hogging Reich. The question now is whether we should assist the Germans in their fight?"

Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, with the end of the Weltkrieg the Germans refused to assist us in our recovery despite fighting with them virtually unnecessarily, and instead the Reich continued to exploit our serious foreign debt problems. The question now is whether we should assist the Germans in their fight?"

Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, despite our contributions to the Central Powers in the Weltkrieg being recognised to an extent, Germany seized control of Romania's coveted oil supplies for itself and has neglected us ever since. The question now is whether we should assist the Reich?"
gerfor.53.a:0 "We owe them. It is time to repay the debt!"

gerfor.59.t:0 "Bulgaria Refused to Help!"

gerfor.61.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire Promises Some Support"
gerfor.61.d:0 "Though the Sultan was sympathetic to our cause, he made it clear that he did not wish to drag his realm into a needless war with the Internationale. Instead he promised to give us material support and to send volunteers."
gerfor.61.a:0 "The irony is palpable."

gerfor.62.t:0 "Bulgaria Promises Some Support"

Although the people are exhausted from years of war, there still remains a strong pro-German sentiment amongst the ruling class and a desire to stand side by side with the victors of the new order.\n\nNonetheless our empire does not intend to sell its skin cheaply and has demanded that the Caucasus, traditionally part of the Ottoman sphere, be restored to its control and that Azerbaijan becomes more tightly connected to the Sublime Porte.

gerfor.110.d:0 "Despite the isolation of South America it appears that somehow Venezuela was unable to keep our oil safe. Our previously uninterrupted supply chain has fallen apart and oil shortages are already making themselves known in the Vaterland and across our colonial empire."
gerfor.110.a:0 "Why is it always the oil?"

gerfor.111.t:0 "Commercial Vessels Refuse to Sail to Venezuela!"
gerfor.111.d:0 "With us being at war we need all of the manpower we can get, and our vital oil supply links with Venezuela have become dependent on civilian ships transporting much of our oil. Unfortunately it is becoming increasingly clear that due to the danger of ships being sunk commercial shippers are becoming reluctant to take the oil, which is causing our oil imports to drop precipitously. Yet again our oil supplies are severely endangered."
gerfor.111.a:0 "Only cowards lack faith in the Kaiserliche Marine."

gerfor.113.t:0 "German Proposes Trade for Oil"
gerfor.113.d:0 "The Germans have come to us asking for an economic trade zone of sorts, governed by a new special treaty. They have promised to invest in our industry and give us preferential treatment. In exchange they request we open up the oil markets to the Reich, allow our companies to drill and guarantee the oil trade to avert crisis at home."
gerfor.113.a:0 "A deal with our German friends!"
gerfor.113.b:0 "We can hold out for more."

gerfor.114.t:0 "Cossacks Accept the Oil Treaty!"
gerfor.114.d:0 "After the promise of getting their economy jumpstarted with German investment the Cossacks of the Don-Kuban Union have agreed fully to our treaty. They promise to maintain the oil supply and give the Reich preferential access to the fields."
gerfor.114.a:0 "Our influence grows."

gerfor.115.t:0 "Cossacks Refuse the Oil Treaty!"
gerfor.115.d:0 "Not impressed with the offer of an economic trade zone and investment, the Cossacks have turned us down. Fortunately there are others still interested in working with us."
gerfor.115.a:0 "Perhaps they have interests elsewhere."

gerfor.116.t:0 "The Reich's New Offer"
gerfor.116.d:0 "After the Germans provided us with a lackluster trade deal in exchange for our oil supplies, they have come forward with a new proposal offering military aid to our force so long as we guarantee the oil. Clearly the German delegation bothered to do their research this time, since military support is actually something we need."
gerfor.116.a:0 "Soon we shall have a truly modern force."
gerfor.116.b:0 "We are not a puppet like the Balts."

gerfor.117.t:0 "Cossacks Accept the Renegotiated Treaty"
gerfor.117.d:0 "An offer of military support was exactly what the Cossacks were interested in, and they have agreed the new proposal put forward by our diplomatics on the ground. In exchange for the German Heer training their military up Don-Kuban will guarantee the oil supplies."
gerfor.117.a:0 "They clearly prefer the finer things."

gerfor.118.t:0 "Cossacks Refuse the Renegotiated Treaty"
gerfor.118.d:0 "Even after a second offer of military support and a variety of German concessions in the treaty negotiation the Cossacks have no interest of working with us. They have spurned our goodwill and holding out for further concessions they have damaged the potential for an agreement."
gerfor.118.a:0 "Such a stubborn people."

gerfor.119.t:0 "Ensuring the Protection of the Oil Fields"
gerfor.119.d:0 "Russia has been threatening Azerbaijan, which controls the Baku Oil Fields, an region incredibly rich with the so-called black gold. We must ensure that Russia does not take these oil fields, and if possible, secure them for ourselves. We are going to hold a conference in Baku in order to negotiate with Azerbaijan the best way forward, by ensuring the survival of the Azeri state - and more importantly, the oil they hold."
gerfor.119.a:0 "It's Baku or bust."

gerfor.120.t:0 "Germany Proposes the Baku Conference"
gerfor.120.d:0 "Germany has come to us with a proposal for a conference in Baku. Us and representatives of the Reich will be the only attendees and we will seek to negotiate the future of our oil fields and ways to ensure that the Russians don't threaten us over them. How should we respond?"
gerfor.120.a:0 "Attend the conference."
gerfor.120.b:0 "This threatens our sovereignty, refuse."

gerfor.121.t:0 "Azerbaijan Refused to Attend the Conference"
gerfor.121.d:0 "Azerbaijan has refused to attend the conference, stating categorically that they believe such a move would herald damage to their national sovereignty and compromise their continued independence. Without their help, we might remain short of oil for a while longer."
gerfor.121.a:0 "We'll find different partners then."
gerfor.121.b:0 "Those oil fields will be ours one day."
gerfor.121.c:0 "We'll take the oil by right of conquest!"

gerfor.122.t:0 "The Baku Conference"
gerfor.122.d:0 "The Baku Conference has offically begun, with diplomats from both countries in attendance. The diplomats from Azerbaijan are waiting to hear what our terms will be."
gerfor.122.a:0 "Demand a fixed amount of oil each year in exchange for a guarantee."
gerfor.122.b:0 "Demand they embargo Russia and give us yearly oil in exchange for a guarantee."
gerfor.122.c:0 "Demand direct control over Azeri oil fields."

gerfor.123.t:0 "Oil for a Guarantee"
gerfor.123.d:0 "The German proposal ended up being suprisingly tame, asking simply for a monthly import of oil in exchange for them guaranteeing our independence, essentially keeping us safe from Russia for as long as this deal lasts. It would be foolish to refuse."
gerfor.123.a:0 "Very reasonable."
gerfor.123.b:0 "We can't give up our oil."

gerfor.124.t:0 "Baku Conference is Successful"
gerfor.124.d:0 "The Azeri government has accepted our gracious offer, guaranteeing us oil for as long as this deal lasts. Assuming that all goes well, the oil shortage is finally over."
gerfor.124.a:0 "The black gold flows again!"

gerfor.125.t:0 "Baku Conference Fails"
gerfor.125.d:0 "The Azerbaijani government has foolishly refused our generous offer, and it seems that the entire conference itself has collapsed. A few diplomats still remain in the building that we could possibly threaten..."
gerfor.125.a:0 "We'll look for oil elsewhere."
gerfor.125.b:0 "Threaten Azerbaijan with war."

gerfor.126.t:0 "Germany Threatens War!"
gerfor.126.d:0 "Due to our recent refusal of the German deal at the Baku Conference, it seems the German government has threatened us with war if we do not accept their demands. The choice seems clear here, as war with the Kaiserreich would almost certainly mean the end."
gerfor.126.a:0 "We have no choice."
gerfor.126.b:0 "We remain firm on our decision."

gerfor.127.t:0 "Azerbaijan Still Refuses!"
gerfor.127.d:0 "Despite the fact that we, a mighty empire, have threatened tiny Azerbaijan with war, their government has refused to budge on the oil issue. The questions remains, should we act on our threats?"
gerfor.127.a:0 "They asked for this."
gerfor.127.b:0 "We are no warmongerers."

gerfor.128.t:0 "Germany Demands Oil and an Embargo on Russia"
gerfor.128.d:0 "Germany's demands were a bit more radical then expected, with them not only demanding oil but also for us to embargo Russia in order to cut off their oil supplies. While our independence will still be gaurenteed, Russia will bear much more resentment towards us. In the long run this could pose serious risk to our nation."
gerfor.128.a:0 "We'll accept."
gerfor.128.b:0 "We can't embargo Russia, but the oil is fine."
gerfor.128.c:0 "This was a bad idea."

gerfor.129.t:0 "Azerbaijan Accepts the Oil Treaty"
gerfor.129.d:0 "Azerbaijan has accepted the entirety of our deal, which promises to starve the Russians of oil and provide us with it. Not only have we strengthened ourselves greatly, we have managed to successfully cripple an enemy in the process."
gerfor.129.a:0 "I almost feel bad for them."

gerfor.130.t:0 "Azerbaijan Changes the Deal"
gerfor.130.d:0 "Azerbaijan has changed the treaty to a much more mild approach, removing the Russian embargo clause so that we only get oil from them. In a negotiation one must always make compromises, but the power disparity between us and the Azeris is massive. Should we accept the clause variation?"
gerfor.130.a:0 "We'll concede on the embargo point."
gerfor.130.b:0 "Take it or leave it."

gerfor.131.t:0 "Germany Refuses to Give Concessions"
gerfor.131.d:0 "Germany has refused our tamer approach at the conference, and stated that the deal will be off if we do not both guarantee oil supplies and embargo the Russians. It seems we can't make them budge on this point, so acceptance may be our only option. The alternative could be catastrophic."
gerfor.131.a:0 "Fine then."
gerfor.131.b:0 "Then the conference will end here."

gerfor.132.t:0 "Azerbaijan Refuses Again"
gerfor.132.d:0 "Azerbaijan has refused our deal yet again, and officially put an end to the Baku Conference. The only option left if we want the oil fields is to threaten them with war. The puny state would be foolish to resist us."
gerfor.132.a:0 "We'll look for oil elsewhere."
gerfor.132.b:0 "Third times a charm. Oil or war!"

gerfor.133.t:0 "Germany Threatens War!"
gerfor.133.d:0 "Germany, fed up with us refusing not once, but twice, has threatened us with war if their side of the deal is not met. The Reich is seemingly willing to fight us over this issue, so the oil must clearly be worth a lot to them. A war would mean an end to our country, so we may have no choice..."
gerfor.133.a:0 "Give them their damn treaty."
gerfor.133.b:0 "This is ridiculous!"

gerfor.134.t:0 "Germany Demands Direct Control of Our Oil Fields"
gerfor.134.d:0 "The German diplomats have claimed in the conference that the Azeri government and industrial sector is not equipped to properly exploit the oil deposits in the country. They have recommended allowing them to have complete oversight of our industries by placing German directors into key positions in state-owned oil companies, meaning that together we can access even more oil. While we could all get rich off the deal, the problem is that this could possibly threaten our position as an independent nation."
gerfor.134.a:0 "Well alright then..."
gerfor.134.b:0 "Economic influence is enough, we shall have no directors."
gerfor.134.c:0 "Refuse outright."

gerfor.135.t:0 "Azerbaijan Accepts!"
gerfor.135.d:0 "Azerbaijan has accepted our recent deal, giving us direct control over their oil fields and industry. This essentially makes them another one of our subjects, securing oil for a very long time."
gerfor.135.a:0 "Let the black gold flow."

gerfor.136.t:0 "Azerbaijan Varies the Treaty"
gerfor.136.d:0 "Azerbaijan has vetoed the idea of us having our directors manage their oil companies, and they only wish to have economic guidance. Our influence over the country and its oil supplies would still be immense, though substantially less than with our German oversight of the oil industry itself."
gerfor.136.a:0 "We'll accept the change."
gerfor.136.b:0 "It's this or nothing!"

gerfor.137.t:0 "Germany Accepts the Modified Treaty"
gerfor.137.d:0 "Germany has accepted our version of the treaty, which help us get more out of our oil fields and whilst also gaining us a guarantee from the Reich. In exchange all we need do is ensure that the oil supply remains unmolested and that the shipments reach Germany."
gerfor.137.a:0 "Great!"

gerfor.138.t:0 "Germany Reaffirms the Original Proposal"
gerfor.138.d:0 "The Reich's diplomats have seemingly not budged on their position on having German directors control our oil fields, and this is simply unacceptable for us as it essentially makes us a puppet of Germany. Unfortunately the threat of war is present if we refuse. How do we respond?"
gerfor.138.a:0 "It's this or war."
gerfor.138.b:0 "Maybe the Russians will help?"
gerfor.138.c:0 "We said no the first time, we'll say it again."

gerfor.139.t:0 "Azerbaijan Requests Assistance"
gerfor.139.d:0 "Ever since the collapse of the Baku Conference between Germany and Azerbaijan over the oil supply, tensions have been heating up. Germany has now formally threatened them with war. Azeri diplomats have sent a telegram asking for our assistance in the matter, and a reward of oil might be in it for us if we help. The question is, should we pressure Germany to back down?"
gerfor.139.a:0 "Send a stern message to Germany."
gerfor.139.b:0 "We won't upset the Germans."

gerfor.140.t:0 "Germany Proposes Research Treaty"
gerfor.140.d:0 "The German government has proposed a military research treaty between our two nations. Though relations between our two nations have not been particularly close for some time, we could benefit greatly from German military assistance."
gerfor.140.a:0 "This sounds like a good idea!"
gerfor.140.b:0 "Bulgaria needs no help."

gerfor.141.t:0 "Bulgaria Accepts the Research Treaty"
gerfor.141.d:0 "Bulgaria has accepted our very generous military research treaty. As our old Central Power ally it is in our best interests that they succeed in Balkan affairs."
gerfor.141.a:0 "Wonderful!"

gerfor.142.t:0 "Bulgaria Refuses the Research Treaty"
gerfor.142.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Bulgarian government has declined our military research treaty, as they see it as 'unnecessary' for their current military plans."
gerfor.142.a:0 "Fine then."

gerfor.143.t:0 "Germany Demands Gibraltar"
gerfor.143.d:0 "The ambassador of Germany has informed us of recent developments in the Reich. As a result of a recent policy change in Berlin their current priority is solidifying their control over the Mediterranean. Already in control of the Suez, they are now demanding that we hand the Rock over to them."
gerfor.143.a:0 "Well, do we even have a choice?"
gerfor.143.b:0 "Refuse this outrageous demand."

gerfor.144.t:0 "Spain Hands Over Gibraltar"
gerfor.144.d:0 "Spain, conscious of the righteousness of our claim on Gibraltar, have decided to give the land to us."
gerfor.144.a:0 "Smart!"

gerfor.145.t:0 "Spain Refused Our Demands"

gerfor.146.t:0 "The Yemen Question"
gerfor.146.d:0 "For a long time, we have wanted to have the Yemeni nation in our sphere of influence so as to safeguard the approaches to the Red Sea and Suez Canal. Now that we have the opportunity to do so, what shall we offer them to incentivise them?"

gerfor.157.t:0 "Russia Threatens Us"
gerfor.157.d:0 "Apparently, at the instigiation of the Azeri government, Russia has gotten involved in the Baku oil dispute and threatened to go to war with us if we enter Azerbaijan's borders. A war with the Russians would be bloody and, while valuable, the Baku oil fields are probably not worth losing a million German men over."

With the largest nation on the planet subjugated by the greatest military power on Earth, we could have easily bent the nation to our own desires and oppressed the local Russian people without obstruction or reproach, but instead we graciously decided to bring civilization to this savage, frozen wasteland. As our war machine tore through the nation, in its wake we planted the seeds of Prussian Constitutionalism - the noblest form of government in existence as exemplified by the glorious Kaiserreich. Our efforts have now paid off, for our collaborative government has finally begun to pay dividends, stabilizing the bulk of the Russian heartland under its rule and paving the way for an able administration to take the reins of the Russian people’s destiny. \n\nHowever, now we must decide what form of government this new puppet-state shall be. Russia has a long and storied history of monarchism, so much so that autocratic rule comes naturally to them. Keeping in line with Berlin, we could fill the Russian throne with true noble blood. The prime candidate is Prince Louis Ferdinand von Preussen, both a Hohenzollern by blood and Romanov by marriage, being Wilhelm III’s son and married to Grand Duchess Kira Kirillovna who herself is daughter of Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich - cousin to Tsar Nicholas II and grandson of Tsar Alexander II. However, if we were to choose this young Prussian Prince, we would likely face great backlash from the Russian populace. With that in mind, perhaps it would be more wise to let the Russian people decide their own fate under the Hegemony of the Kaiserreich."

However, we are not alone on this newly-secured continent, for our old allies and bickering brother to the South in Vienna have managed to survive as well, and now we must decide on what to do with them. \n\nAlthough we were allies in the Great War, we have since fallen out of favor with one another despite our occasional cooperation, but many still call for our unification like it was the time of the Kleindeutschlanders and Großdeutschlanders all over again, and perhaps there is some stock in their desires. Put on the shelf as it became clear that another world war was beginning to rear its ugly head once more, the ‘Kaisergipfel’ or Kaiser Summit plan would have the Kaisers in Vienna and Berlin come together to meet as equals in order to discuss the future of Europe and the Pan-European and Pan-German questions once and for all.

Delighting many Pan-European theorists throughout the Empire like Count Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi and Milan Hodža, as well as many Pan-Germans like Karl Hermann Wolf and George Ritter von Schönerer, and the German Bohemians under Konrad Henlein, to name a few, this idea of a ‘Kaisergipfel’ or Kaiser Summit could be promising, but could also spell the end of Austrian independence as well as we potentially unify with Berlin.

What was said behind those closed doors will likely never be truly known, but the outcome of which will reverberate through time immemorial regardless of the outcome as the future of an entire continent, and the entire Western World along with it, hangs in the balance. As the Kaiser in Berlin tried to convince the Kaiser in Austria to be a secondary monarch among many within a unified Pan-European system under the German crown, or perhaps a dual crown shared equally by both monarchs, the Austrian Kaiser nearly left multiple times, but yet the summit lasted, at least for awhile, as two of the most powerful men on the face of planet hashed it out for the good of Europe. With the Summit going on for hours at first that soon turned into days, a final decision needed to be made soon, and so what shall be the outcome of the Kaisergipfel as the fate of the continent hangs in the balance?"

Though the first phase focused on our relationship with our southern Catholic brothers, the second phase deals with the rest of the continent at large as we shift our focus from a Pan-Germanic direction towards the realization of the Pan-European idyll. Should the Kaiserreich continue to exert its influence beyond the Germanic lands of Central Europe, across the cradle of Western Civilization until all of Europe from Iberia to the Urals is united so that we can build our unified, syncretic culture that truly is the height of human perfection on the face of the earth, and if so how should we approach this noble goal, or should we ignore these misplace and naive fantasies in order to focus on building our Pan-Germanic paradise while strengthening the Reichspakt and Mitteleuropa without advancing them to their natural Pan-European conclusions?"

Seeking to further Germanic settlement across the scattered lands of the Kaiserreich while simultaneously drawing our colonies and puppets closer to Berlin to the point of inseparability, these internationalists - calling themselves imperial globalists and other similar terms to distinguish themselves from the foul Trotskyite menace that is Leftist Internationalism - push for the total national unification of the entire German Empire, and have gone to great lengths to convince the Kaiser and His Highness’ government of the merits of their ambition.

While government efforts in the sphere of propaganda are still ongoing, constantly attempting to display the full splendor of our wondrous conquests, there have been some suggestions for a far more "decisive" propaganda campaign than simple posters, paid headlines, and interviews.\n\nEven as the state budget remains under close scrutiny, more than a few idealistic civil servants have tried to persuade the Reichskanzler towards the funding of a massive film project, with a flagship title that will likely end up as the most expensive movie ever produced in Germany. So far, only the concept of creating a leading film, alongside companion productions on a smaller scale, has been gaining traction amongst the DkP. The world of films has already shown its use in capturing the minds of the people more than any other medium, and most DkP members have grown affectionate towards the "Kinoprojekt", claiming it will help shake off their image as an "unchanging" force.\n\nThe conservative bureaucracy might not be the most well-versed in making movies, but thanks to the full resources of the state every possible director, film subject, and actor is up for the taking in order to ensure total artistic success. In the best case scenario, the budget may even be fully recouped in mesmerizing profits alongside mobilizing our people into loving Germany as much as they had before!"

gerdom.285.d:0 "After much deliberation which ended with us picking a concrete theme for the coming cinematic work, we are now faced with an even tougher decision. Who shall be given the reins of this potential cinematic masterpiece?\n\nAs the funding is not an issue, due to the Universum-Film AG receiving full support Chancellery, the question facing the board is who could be up to the task of creating a masterwork in propaganda. It will take a person who is not afraid to treat the subject with the respect it deserves, and thus even some notable directors such as Robert Siodmak, Ernst Lubitsch or F. W. Murnau have been already excluded pending certain qualms about the specifics of their current work and character.\n\nTo expedite the process a special group made up of experts from the Deutschkonservative Partei and the UFA formulated a final list of four directors that could be tasked with the monumental job before them. The first, and most promising according to many within the cabinet, is Veit Harlan. While so far mostly known for acting, he has created a few dramas which show that there is potential in the young filmmaker, especially as he's not related to any explicitly public political movement according to our investigation. The second, and perhaps more surprising, is Victor Tourjansky, a Russian émigré that left his homeland during the outbreak of the Civil War and then moved to Germany from his temporary abode in Crimea after the intervention was over. Despite the cries of the most rightist elements of the party, others note that immigrants have already proven themselves as directors in other nations, pointing to the fame acquired by Charlie Chaplain after he moved to the USA. The third, and more conventional of choices compared to Tourjansky yet still with notable worries, is Karl Ritter. On the surface, he’d be a perfect candidate, a Weltkrieg veteran who turned his gaze towards the cinema business. Yet, what concerns the moderates within our party is that Ritter is open about his far-right views, and could influence the movie's final shape to fit Schleicherist, or worse, perspectives, something that the supporters of the fighter pilot shoot down by reminding us of the popularity of D. W. Griffith's radically political "The Birth of a Nation". The final choice, the most exotic of all, would be to hire Leni Riefenstahl. As strange as it may seem to hire a young woman, even borderline heretical according to many within our party, she has already proven herself by her work on the "Unser Kampf" film project. Not only that, but they also note that female directors are capable of creating impactful movies like the work of Alice Guy-Blaché proves. Riefenstahl could be convinced to work for the state on future propaganda pieces, but would also provide a boost in our perception among the women's movement.\n\nA final decision will ultimately be made, the UFA knows that it cannot delay the subject forever, but any proposal they announce must meet with the approval of the Reichskanzler. So who shall the man, or woman, that will carry the German people towards a great triumph on the screen be?"

While Ritter is firm in making the stunts theatrical in measure, his understanding of what is possible for a pilot to accomplish has resulted in a shockingly low amount of accidents on set, which other aviation-focused films can only be envious over.\n\nRitter, thanks to his background, has been able to garner respect from some of the leading actors, resulting in some promising displays through the camera. While the man's own flying days are behind him, his dedication to the filming craft has made him confident that this piece will inspire a new generation towards the Luftwaffe. The news has assuaged a bit of anxiety among the DkP, who wondered if fixating upon pilots and their bombastic behavior would only spell a total disaster.\n\nOf most use, however, is Ritter's capacity for maximizing his budget effectively. While some of the spending has raised a few eyebrows, the effect has been quite substantial. Not only is there a wide array of shots taken of the ground, the pilots affecting an ongoing battle beneath them, but the money spent has led to most of the used planes being able to be painted and reworked in a manner befitting the illustrious, near fantastical, appearances of the Red Baron's old Flying Circus.

Now their wishes have finally come true, as a state of war now exists between our glorious Vaterland and the nest of vipers to our west. Kaiser Wilhelm II explained the reasons for Germany's involvement in another war with France in a special radio address, and called for eradication of final obstacle to achieving "A Place in the Sun". Subsequently thousands of young Germans rushed to enlist in the military, following the example of the Kaiser's grandsons, and civilians began gathering on the streets publicly displaying their support for the war.

The paper reported that two daughters of Freiherr Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord, a leading general and friend of influential Reichskriegsminister von Schleicher, were involved in shady dealings with Syndicalist-aligned intelligence agencies. Shortly afterwards, the Reichstag member Franz Seldte fanned the flames by asking why the Abwehr, run by von Schleicher's friend Ferdinand von Bredow, was not able to find out that the family of an associate of the War Secretary was infiltrated by hostile intelligence. While General von Hammerstein-Equord resigned and publicly apologised for his daughters' doings, the real question for von Schleicher is - should he pull strings to replace von Bredow and remove any further threats to his political career from that direction, and if yes - replace him with whom?"

On the one hand he was a hero of the Weltkrieg, the orchestrator of German victory in the 1919 fall of France. On the other hand, most Germans haven't forgotten the ensuing military dictatorship that only ended when Admiral Von Tirpitz forced him to retire after the infamous Osthilfeskandal in 1924. Although Ludendorff still received some honours for his service, like his knighthood, the former quartermaster-general mostly led a secluded life at his estate afterwards."

While the Reich enjoyed prosperity under Tirpitz's reign, he also continued to hold off on fulfilling the Kaiser's Easter Promises made in 1917, leaving us with political tensions brewing in recent years.\n\nStill, his prestige is enormous, and the anniversary of his death has been accompanied by public demonstrations of respect all over the Empire."

As part of the FVP's new Mitteleuropa immigration program, the majority of people aboard the vessel were skilled laborers, possessing skills that they had acquired over a very long career. While there is no shortage of skilled labor in the Kaiserreich, there is optimism that this cultural and laboral diffusion will lead to closer relations between our two states. Their arrival was unremarkable, with the delegation quickly being interrupted by a minor group of conservatives, displeased with the arrival of Irish Catholics. However, we are confident that the Bavarians in our delegation helped our guests to disregard the outburst and feel more welcome in their new home, due to their shared Catholic heritage."

This was confirmed later in the day when Vorbeck officially named them as generals in the Imperial German Army. While some political pundits are accusing Paul of nepotism for promoting his nephew, it's no secret that both men were inspired by the renewed patriotism of Lettow-Vorbeck's Germany and both want to take the fight directly to the despicable Communards."

As part of the DkP's ongoing cultural centralization efforts, the best professional teams from all across the German Empire will compete in a single Reichsliga in a system that until now has been dominated by powerful regional federations of amateur sides, with maybe one or two dominant sides per region, predictably leading to lopsided results. While Hertha isn't expected to win the league, supporters have still come to the stadium in droves as most of them had never seen top competition before. The Kaiser himself is at the match, and while still dressed in his traditional military uniform, the press note that hints of Hertha's blue and white can be seen."

Though expensive and fragile, we have been able to send a few models to the major colonies and constituent members of the Reichspakt, allowing our armies and the armies of our subjects to utilize this unique technology. With our growing airfleet also using autogyros, rotabuggies, and other novel transports devised by crack German scientists and our allied lackeys, we shall be able to ferry our populace, our goods, and our troops all around the Kaiserreich without issue or delay while also delivering devastating payloads at a moment’s notice.

The centerpiece invention of these new shipments are the Focke-Achgelis Fa 223 Drache, or Dragon. These ‘Dragons’ are unique aircraft that can take off and land vertically, and have been dubbed helicopters by the initial designers. Primarily designed to quickly ferry supplies and precious cargo in and out of rough areas and terrain, some of these ‘Dragons’ have also been out-fitted with weaponry, functioning as basic light aerial gunships and bombers. Looking more like something out of Da Vinci’s sketchbooks and less like a real war machine, we shall give these new helicopters and the other tech the Germans sent us a thorough testing against the varied enemies of the Kaiserirech and the wider Reichspakt."

gerfla.19.t:0 "The Bauhaus Question"
gerfla.19.d:0 "Founded by Berlin-born artist Walter Gropius in the years following our victory in the Great War, the Staatliches Bauhaus is one of the Kaiserreich’s most famous, or infamous, art schools that first opened its doors in 1919 after working within the Deutscher Werkbund art union founded by Hermann Muthesius in 1907. Aimed at the creation of a Gesamtkunstwerk, or a comprehensive artwork in which all the different mediums of art in all its forms would be brought together in order to feed each other in a new, comprehensive artistic revolution based on non-Leftist Internationalism, anti-Expressionism, New Objectivity/New Sobriety (called Neues Bauen or Neue Saclichkeit in German), and new concepts of liberal German Modernism and the avant-garde. With three campuses now existing in Berlin, Dessau, and Weimar as the movement explodes in popularity, the Bauhaus group has largely been dominated by rival architect-directors Walter Gropius, Hannes Meyer, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, along with famous artists like Paul Klee, Wassily Kandisnky, László Moholy-Nagy, Oskar Schlemmer, Ernst May, Martin Wagner, Bruno Taut, Bruno Paul, Erich Mendelsohn, Hans Poelzig, Adolf Meyer, Peter Behrens, Joost Schmidt, and more, all dedicated to the creation of rational, functional, and non-fanciful art that flies in the face of the baroque, imposing classic architecture traditional throughout the Kaiserreich and the rising Völkisch movements that resist the march of progress. \n\nDespite their growing popularity, and their sole focus on art and nothing else like their famous new fonts and futurist art dedicate to the adaptation of German architecture towards something that fits ‘our world of machines, radios, and fast cars’, the Bauhaus group have been accused of harboring radically liberal or Leftist sentiments, holding traitorous ties to the Russian constructivist Vkhutemas art school, and harboring anti-monarchist sentiments, though none of these claims have been verified, likely just being hearsay spread by Bauhaus’ detractors. Regardless, this has not stopped many reactionary groups from going after the Left-ish artist guild while supporting rival art movements and typefaces like the dated Fraktur style and its rivalry with the Antiqua and Textura movements, or more modern attempts at a medieval-esque styles like Fraktur's proposed replacements of Kurrentschrift or Sütterlin, forcing our administration’s hand and leaving the decision of what to do with these artists up to the Crown. So what shall we do?"

gerfla.20.d:0 "Friedrich August Georg Ferdinand Albert Karl Anton Paul Marcellus, or simply King Georg of Saxony, has managed to seize the headlines in German newspapers despite the crisis previously possessing a monopoly on the front page: Georg has abdicated his throne in favor of a life in the Catholic Church, specifically in the Jesuit Order.\n\nRuling as the King of Saxony since his father's death in 1932, Georg had shockingly been thinking over the concept of abdication for years as the intrigues of noble life in the German Empire had been "intellectually limiting", all this exacerbated by what he viewed as his inability to truly help others across the Empire during the ongoing economic crisis and the increasing radicalism of both left and right. As his personal noblesse oblige led him to serving on the front in the Weltkrieg, even being wounded for it, so it again seemed to push him towards a life of theological work among the people he once represented as a king, believing that public religious teachings can help direct the population away from radicalism.\n\nHe has made it apparent he wishes to offer religious guidance and a spirited promotion of ecumenism, desiring a perspective of cooperativeness towards Protestant elements across the fatherland. The former king is well within his rights to abdicate, but as openly altruistic as his motivations are there remained some controversy in the halls of power. Notably, various Prussian nobles have voiced a concern over a German monarch holding such large swaths of foreign territory, permitted to operate an "exterior fiefdom" outside of the Empire's direct control, granting a possible manipulator far too much power than he should wield.\n\nFor now these "issues of state stability" are remaining only in the mouths of squawking old priests and noblemen, leaving Georg's abdication to be seen as most as the pinnacle of a nobleman's duty, but their paranoid proclamations have reopened a few questions on the status of Poland in the Reichspakt and the status quo of Prussianism in the eyes of the cunning few..."

Famous as the \"Malerherzog\" (Painting Duke) or the \"Duke who never wanted to be Duke\", Ernst, who only ascended to the throne at age 68, was widely known for his keen enthusiasm for the fine arts and his disinterestment in politics, something that stood in stark contrast to the ruling style of his older brother and predecessor Bernhard III, a belliciose admirer of the Prussian way of life. While the legacy of \"only\" 14 years of rule might seem small compared to his father and grandfather who both ruled Saxe-Meiningen for around half a century, Ernst definitely will not be forgotten, as many of the Duke's beautiful self-painted pictures are already displayed as part of a permanent exhibition at the Lindenau Art Museum in Meiningen."

Lauded by critics as a grand example of the poetic realism genre, the film tells the story of an aging and cynical ex-seafarer named Johnny who spends his retirement as a singing entertainer at a club along the Große Freiheit, a street in Hamburg's famous red-light district St. Pauli. After he promises his dying brother to watch for the latter's girlfriend Gisa after his death and allows the young girl, barely 20 years old, to live in his room as a housemaid, he begins to develop feelings of love for the first time in many years - albeit entirely without Gisa suspecting anything, who in the meantime begins courting a shipyard worker without Johnny's knowledge. Johnny becomes so obsessed with the girl that he goes as far to plan proposing to her and giving up his old unstable life, but just when he bought the rings he finds out about Gisa's secret relationship. Aggrieved, ashamed and disgraced, the old seadog decides to leave his old life behind forever and embarks yet again on a ship that same night, never to return.\n\nThe movie has not only become widely popular because of its deeply melancholic and fatalist storyline, which captures the spirit of the wartime era perfectly, but also due to its fantastic soundtrack - many schlagers featured in the film, like the iconic \"La Paloma\" and \"On the Reeperbahn at Half Past Midnight\", have already become instant classics and are played on record players all over Europe."

gerfla.23.d:0 "After a reign of over 53 years, Prince Friedrich of Waldeck-Pyrmont has peacefully passed away today at age 81. Despite his lacking charisma and barely existent political legacy, Friedrich achieved what many German monarchs have dreamt of: he is now officially the longest-reigning sovereign in the 75 years-long history of the German Empire, surpassing even the legendary Wilhelm II by just a few weeks, something that probably makes the \"Eternal Kaiser\" turn in his grave.\n\nThe great insignificance of Prince Friedrich can be attributed not only to the fact that Waldeck is one of Germany's smallest and least populous constituent states, but also to Waldeck's extreme dependency on Prussia. Due to a controversial treaty signed in 1867 as the principality was not able to cover the yearly matricular contributions every member state has to pay, the prince was turned into an irrelevant figurehead, while the internal administration was taken over by the Prussians from nearby Kassel and Hanover. On several occasions, outright dissolution of Waldeck-Pyrmont was on the table, in parts because activists in Bad Pyrmont, who have not much in common with their rulers in Arolsen, called for a unification with the Province of Hanover, but these plans always came to nothing.\n\nIt will be the duty of Friedrich's son, Prince Josias of Waldeck-Pyrmont, to steer the tiny principality through a new era."

gerfla.24.d:0 "Ever since US Congress designated the second Sunday of May as Mother's Day in 1914, as a sign of love and reverence for the mothers of the world, this American tradition has slowly gained traction across the Atlantic. After the end of the Weltkrieg, the Association of German Flower Shop Owners (Verband Deutscher Blumengeschäftsinhaber) took advantage of this as a marketing tactic, promoting the date to raise flower sales in May. The liturgical emphasis of the original vision of the holiday also earned the support of religious conservative groups, who considered it a viable alternative to International Women's Day, initiated by socialist organisations. Movements calling for making it an official holiday earned traction in the German Empire in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nAlongside business owners, conservative societies, and women's rights activists, the campaign in Germany was also endorsed by völkisch groups, who connected the idea of Mother's Day with their far-right ideal of a loyal childbearing mother who is the future of the Germanic master race. All of this has coalesced into an ongoing question as to whether or not Mother's Day should be made an official holiday in the Kaiserreich.

Though it took a while for the team to confirm that what they saw was not merely contamination, Hahn and Strassmann ultimately coined the term Uranspaltung (uranium fission) to describe the phenomenon.\n\nThis may pave the way to new technology, should the presumably enormous energy released by nuclear fission could be contained and used."

gerfla.27.d:0 "In the newest publication of \"Chemiker-Zeitung über die wichtigsten Gebiete der Chemie und chemischen Industrie\", readers could find an article submitted by Hans Krebs M.D., entitled \"The Role of Citric Acid in Intermediate Metabolism in Animal Tissues\". In it, Krebs presented his newest discovery of a cycle of reactions involving the molecule citric acid, that has proven to be essential in the functioning of all living organisms. The process involves a series of cyclical chemical conversions, and is a vital element of cellular respiration, allowing all organisms to function.\n\nThe author of the paper, Dr. Hans Krebs, is a researcher at the University of Freiburg, known for discovering the Ornithine Cycle in 1932. Using previous work by Albert Imre Szent-Györgyi de Nagyrápolt, who discovered several products and reactions in the cycle, Krebs has presented his discoveries in a succinct fashion.\n\nThis recent discovery has been seen as extremely innovative, and Krebs is already receiving further honours and renown in the scientific world. The achievement has also bolstered the reputation of German scientific circles, and more importantly, the Kaiser-Wilhelm Society."

gerfla.28.d:0 "The nominations for the 1940 Nobel Prize in Literature are already reaching the Nobel Prize Committee, and among them is an unexpected name — Wilhelm Storost, more commonly known by the name \"Vydūnas\".\n\nVydūnas is a spiritual leader of the Prussian-Lithuanian community, a member of Theosophist societies, a poet and philosopher, as well as a noted preserver of local traditions, folklore, songs and even their ancient pre-Christian faith, which he has sought to rebuild and redeem. His moral influence among the shrinking Lithuanian-speaking population in East Prussia is unquestioned, and he has even made a name for himself on the other side of the Memelland, in the Kingdom of Lithuania, where his works are read and cited. Of course, he has garnered respect among German intellectuals as well, although his minority status and focus leaves him relatively unknown.\n\nStill, the news were met warmly in Berlin and with joy in Tilsit, and though his victory is not assured at all, merely taking Vydūnas into consideration is a significant accomplishment for the Prussian-Lithuanians. The only point of tension is the possible clash between him and the aristocratic Prussian establishment - a considerable portion of Vydūnas' works is dedicated to the conquest and colonisation of Prussia by the Teutonic Knights, and the destruction of local culture and way of life that this process caused. As not only Prussia, but arguably the Empire itself originates from the territories gained in the Ostsiedlung, this has gotten right-wing press to deride the poet as unpatriotic."

The partition of Thuringia into statelets, each with their own governments and laws, has held back the development and progress of the state for quite some time, and finding a resolution to this division has been on the mind of politicians pursuing centralisation for a while.\n\nAfter some time, and a little pressure from Berlin, a workable agreement has been found - a united Thuringia will be established and Grand Duke Karl August II of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, the largest of the small states, will be crowned Grand Duke of Thuringia. However, the other princes will retain their property and their lineages will be represented in the upper house of the Thuringian Landtag, alongside appointed and elected peers. The lower house will be elected via universal suffrage, and the government will reside in Weimar.\n\nThe Thuringian Constitution has been approved by all state parliaments and the necessary amendments to the Constitution have been approved by the Bundesrat, and so, the Grand Duchy of Thuringia has become a reality."

Among these patriotic volunteers is none other than Marlene Dietrich, the glamorous and beautiful former silent film actress who has visited the frontlines to lift the spirits of those in the trenches.\n\nBorn Marie Magdalene Dietrich on 27 December 1901, she came from an affluent Berliner family and created her name by merging her first two names at 11. With an early background in music, a wrist injury deterred her from a career in the orchestra, and she instead found herself playing minor roles on the silver screen. In 1929, she scored her breakthrough role with the character \"Lola-Lola,\" a cabaret singer, in UFA's production of \"The Blue Angel\" (1930) — directed by Austrian filmmaker Josef von Sternberg. The film's roaring success led von Sternberg and Dietrich to work together for six more films, especially with Dietrich's signature image of a glamorous and mysterious femme fatale. Of her films, Morroco (1930) and Shanghai Express (1932, a film detailing the political turmoil of the Qing Empire), have stood out as true masterpieces. While many of her films were done in the United States, the growing instability of the country — led her to return back to Germany by 1936.\n\nWith the war now in full swing, Dietrich has taken to the airwaves with her rendition of the popular love song \"Lili Marleen.\" The government has commended her for her efforts in mobilising the German war effort and her songs are becoming favorites from soldiers on both sides of the Weltkreig."

This resulted in a sweet fruit-flavored drink of an orange colour. After a brainstorming session, the company's salesmen stumbled upon \"Fantasie\" (Imagination), after one of the company's employees, Max Keith, demanded them to \"use their imagination\". The drink was a success, especially thanks to marketing which described it as a \"local and patriotic alternative\" to existing imported soft drinks.

As Lorentz's book was perceived as a history of Germanisation in Kashubia, Majkòwsczi decided to highlight Kashubian nationality as Slavic by beginning his book with a short history of Slavic Nationalities. He perceived that Western Slavs, including Pomeranians and Kashubians, were influenced by Western Europe — with German as its main influence, strengthened by Germanisation. It was followed by a geographical overview of Kashubia, its local groups, and the historians of the nation. Later the book presented history from legends: through pagan culture, Polish Rule, the Duchy of Pomerelia under the local Sobiesławice dynasty, Teutonic Rule, renewed Polish Administration and finally Prussian Rule which lasts to present day.\n\nAleksander Majkòwsczi didn't live long enough to see his book published as he passed away earlier this year when it was being printed. A committee was formed, made up of his former colleagues, who decided to publish the book in his name alongside his novel \"Żëcé i przigòdë Remùsa\". Since release, the book was met with harsh criticism from the German Right, who call for banning the book, but has been lauded by Kashubian and liberal politicians."

While these opponents of Prussian rule can mostly be found in the distant periphery of the Empire, some of the most ardent regional patriots in fact do not live too far away from the capital — the Lower Saxons, who inhabit the Prussian Province of Hanover, the Duchy of Brunswick, the Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe and the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg. While similar to the Prussians in faith and dialect, they have a strong regional identity that reaches back thousands of years, and the Hanoverians have a deep disdain for the Prussians due to the annexation of their kingdom back in '66, manifested among others in the existence of the Guelph Party (DHP), whose main aim is the restoration of a sovereign Kingdom of Hanover within the Empire.\n\nLower Saxon patriotism however is not confined to the DHP, and this is shown most prominently in the Lower Saxon Homeland League. The oldest German regionalist movement, it evokes an even older image of the flat and marshy territories between Elbe and Ems, celebrating the medieval spirit of the Saxon Kingdom that bravely asserted itself against Romans, Franks and Staufers, and embraces illustrious leaders such as Arminius, Duke Widukind and Henry the Lion, famous scientists like Leibniz and Gauß, and acclaimed writers such as Hermann Löns, Wilhelm Busch and Hoffmann von Fallersleben.\n\nHowever, though local patriotism in the far northwest is strong, it never was enough to actively resist Prussian rule, as petty rivalries have plagued the Lower Saxon movement for decades. The official \"Song of the Lower Saxons\" does not even include the lands west of the Weser. A protestant Harzer does not have much in common with a catholic Emslander, and the Oldenburgers are so proud of their Grand Duchy that they keep a certain distance to their \"brethren\" on the other side of the border. Annually, the Homeland League convenes the so-called \"Lower Saxon Day\" to foster local identity and celebrate their \"common\" history, but one thing is certain - as long as the Prussians control most of the region, the Lower Saxons will remain a spiritually divided people."

gerfla.200.d:0 "The pursuit of technological progress waits for no man, and with war in the air, innovation is as common as the anticipation and emotion that drives it, driving the Kaiserreich, and more specifically our military industry, into overdrive. One such recent benefit from this inspirational flash, though also aided by the Kaiser’s fascination with having his dreamed large navy be realized among the heavens, is the revitalization of the rigid airship program. First started by Graf Ferdinand von Zeppelin and his ‘Luftschiffbau Zeppelin’ company, the German obsession with dirigibles has only grown deeper. Since the Great War ended, the need for militarized zeppelins dropped to a secondary concern as focus was shifted to DELAG - the world’s first commercial airline - in order to cash in on the post-war economic boom. Initially centered around zeppelin airports in Berlin and Friedrichshafen, DELAG has since set up new hubs in cities all across not just Germany but the wider Kaiserreich and Reichspakt at large in an attempt to connect the world for the good of good of Germany and humanity through globalism, and the not-so subtle spread of German soft power. However, with war once again looming on the horizon, we must ready the airfleet for conflict once again. \n\nAlthough the DELAG service shall continue to run unhindered, funds from other areas shall be diverted to the expansion and conversion of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin’s manufacturing capabilities so that we can expand our military airfleet of zeppelins before it is too late, for building them and sourcing the helium needed for them from our trade partners in America, North Africa, and Eastern Europe shall take some time. Until new models can be developed, we shall largely be producing the Hindenburg-class - the largest of its kind currently in existence, for now - with the aging Graf Zeppelin II airship serving as the command ship of the airfleet. Using tactics perfected by zeppelin commanders like Peter Strasser and Hugo Eckener guiding us and our new air crews that are entering training, we shall build the greatest air force the world has ever seen!"

Capable of not only high-altitude bombing missions, recon/supply runs, and cruise line service as current zeppelins are as well, these new super zeppelins are also capable of minor modularization, allowing them to be re-outfitted and re-configured to fit a variety of other combat roles as needed, such as running close-air support or tackling naval targets. With these great flying beasts of war, we have become like the Valkyries themselves, riding forth on mighty winged steeds ready to bring righteous ruination and justice to our foes, so let us do this great Germanic legacy proud by using these new wonder weapons to the best of our ability and their immense potential."

Whatever the case may be, we have these marvels of air travel and warfare now at our disposal, with many within our administration eager to set up air travel services with the rest of the empire by tapping into Germany’s DELAG - the first airline in the world. Utilizing strategies, tactics, plans, and operating manuals penned by Germany’s brightest zeppelin commanders like Hugo Eckener and Peter Strasser along with their complementary training liaison, we shall also focus on military matters, fast tracking new air crews to let us use these new wonders of modern technology to their maximum potential in both commercial and militaristic endeavors.

This program is a key part of further integration and seeks to pool the brightest minds of Europe in German hands."
germit.10.a:0 "We have to sign up."

germit.11.t:0 "Europakommission Membership"
germit.11.d:0 "Though Mitteleuropa nations share a common currency in the form of the Europamark, to be a proper part of the bloc now, a nation must put itself under the jurisdiction of the Europakommission. This body regulates industrial production and quality across the continent, though clearly is biased in favour of the German Empire."
germit.11.a:0 "We have to sign up."

germit.12.t:0 "Paktbrigaden Proposal"
germit.12.d.independent:0 "There has been a new proposal concerning Mitteleuropa emanating from the Berlin think tanks. Germany is now calling for the creation of Paktbrigaden, international divisions organized from conscripts in all Mitteleuropa member states. These conscripted units will be placed under the aegis of the Imperial German Army for the duration of the military emergency. Such a measure would greatly empower Germany."
germit.12.d.subject:0 "There has been a new proposal concerning Mitteleuropa emanating from the Berlin think tanks. Germany is now calling for the creation of Paktbrigaden, international divisions organized from conscripts in all Mitteleuropa member states. These conscripted units will be placed under the aegis of the Imperial German Army for the duration of the military emergency. As a subject nation, we are forced to agree with their proposal."
germit.12.a:0 "Well if it's essential."
germit.12.b:0 "This is pure madness."

germit.13.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepted the Paktbrigaden Programme"
germit.13.d:0 "Our new Paktbrigaden programme is an ingenious idea to encourage our Mitteleuropa 'partners' to give up valuable military-aged men as part of international divisions and then place them directly into our own army, starved as we are to some extent of soldiers. [From.GetNameDefCap] wisely decided to accept our pressure and signed up to the programme. Recruitment should be made far easier."
germit.13.a:0 "Brilliant!"

germit.14.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Rejected the Paktbrigaden Programme"
germit.14.d:0 "Our new Paktbrigaden programme is an ingenious idea to encourage our Mitteleuropa 'partners' to give up valuable military-aged men as part of international divisions and then place them directly into our own army, starved as we are to some extent of soldiers. [From.GetNameDefCap] unfortunately refused to bow to our pressure and decided not to become a part of the new programme, damaging our efforts to integrate Mitteleuropa."
germit.14.a:0 "Irritating."

germit.20.t:0 "Establishment of Lithuanian Air Lines"
germit.20.d:0 "Today, the formation of Lietuvos oro linijos, or Lithuanian Air Lines, has been officially finalized. While only two small planes, both named after trans-Atlantic Lithuanian pilots, are in the starting fleet, the line seems to already be rather popular among the Lithuanian population, who has gained a bit of national pride in having a more locally-run air line rather than relying on Deutsche Lufthansa. With trained former air force pilots and a new modernized airport in the resort city of Palanga, which now has become even more tempting for further investment from the tourism business, the Lithuanians are thoroughly set for success thanks to Berlin.\n\nWith this move, the Empire has shown that even some of its smallest members can be uplifted into the comforts granted by new technology!"
germit.20.a:0 "Palanga should be beautiful this summer!"
