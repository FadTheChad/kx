# Events #

turkestan_events.1.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands Our Submission"
turkestan_events.1.d: "Confident in their growing strength or perhaps merely seeking to project it in these times of troubles, we have received a series of demands from [FROM.GetLeader]'s government demanding our immediate recognition of their authority. This would naturally entail the stationing of troops, adhering to their decrees and likely further tributes that would naturally be sent to a national government.\n\nCalling their bluff of course, is always an option. It will likely mean war, though freedom from tyranny often requires such a price. Especially in warlord-era China, the nation is littered with failed governments who overstretched themselves assailing \"weak\" and \"vulnerable\" factions. Submitting for now and playing the long-game is also an option as well."
turkestan_events.1.a: "We acquiesce to their demands."
turkestan_events.1.b: "We stand defiant!"
turkestan_events.1.c: "We are the legitimate government of Turkestan!"

turkestan_events.2.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Submits to Our Authority"
turkestan_events.2.d: "Seeing few potential options to preserve their autonomy and believing us to be their best one, the government of [FROM.GetLeader] has agreed to recognise us as the legitimate rulers of China. In doing so they have committed to harmonising their laws with ours, provide troops for our wars, and commit to further coordination in national affairs.\n\nIn return however they have in practice preserved much of their old government, as well as the patronage networks that operate underneath. Warlord troops have always been known to be unwieldy and the warlords themselves untrustworthy. Further integration will have to be discussed another day, for now though the status quo works."
turkestan_events.2.a: "We are magnanimous rulers."

turkestan_events.3.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Yield!"
turkestan_events.3.d: "Despite our efforts to settle the matter peacefully, [FROM.GetLeader] has formally renounced our efforts at promoting national unity and begun mobilising [FROM.GetAdjective] units in a show of force to try and ward us off. [FROM.GetLeader.GetSheHeCap] has also ejected all of our representatives and denounced our government as illegitimate, spreading such vile lies throughout [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nNaturally his actions are a grave insult, but our best course of action remains to be seen. Given the stubborn and fickle nature of warlords, rejection was always in the cards. But enforcing our will on [FROM.GetNameDef] will require allocating forces which may be spent elsewhere. Timing, as always, is everything."
turkestan_events.3.a: "Let us begin a buildup at the border."
turkestan_events.3.b: "The invasion begins now!"

turkestan_events.7.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Invites us to Join Ranks"
turkestan_events.7.d: "Even as China grew more and more divided, there were many across the nation that shared a common vision for the future of the nation. These kindred spirits were often divided by mountains and rivers, forced to fight their own regional battles for dominance. Still, it is always a pleasant sight when the stars align and comrades independently take power.\n\n[FROM.GetLeader] of [FROM.GetNameDef] has identified our [ROOT.GetRulingParty] as an ally in their quest to liberate the nation. [ROOT.GetLeader] has been invited to join forces, bringing China ever closer to unification without firing a shot."
turkestan_events.7.a: "We accept wholeheartedly."
turkestan_events.7.b: "We are not affiliated with one another."

turkestan_events.8.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Joins our Ranks!"
turkestan_events.8.d: "Thanks in part to the similar roots between [FROM.GetRulingParty] and our own [ROOT.GetRulingParty], it appears that our goals have remained aligned over the years. [FROM.GetLeader] of [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to begin coordinating our efforts at unification, peacefully bringing [FROM.GetNameDef] into the [ROOT.GetAdjective] fold.\n\nWith any luck, our combined forces will be sufficient to bring about successful national liberation from the chaos and strife that has engulfed it. With momentum on our side, the combined might of our forces will continue onwards to victory!"
turkestan_events.8.a: "One cause for one nation."

turkestan_events.9.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Denies our Alliance!"
turkestan_events.9.d: "Despite the similar roots of the [FROM.GetRulingParty] and our own [ROOT.GetRulingParty], it appears that our goals have diverged over the years. [FROM.GetLeader] of [FROM.GetNameDef] has denied our efforts at peacefully unifying our cause against mutual enemies, instead electing to go their own route.\n\nThis treason can only be explained by their own selfishness and inability to think beyond their own interests. Whatever the case, it appears that it is up to us to bear the true legacy of Xinhai, and carve a future for all the Chinese people."
turkestan_events.9.a: "[FROM.GetAdjective] traitors ought to at least stay out of our way."

turkestan_events.50.t: "The New Capital"
turkestan_events.50.d: "With the unification of Turkestan, it is finally time to set the permanent seat of the new central government. Tashkent would be the natural choice, an ancient city that has been an administrative center during the Tsarist Era, and a rapidly developing industrial and financial urban area.\n\nThe other choice is to keep all the bureaucracy in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], as a symbol of our rule."
turkestan_events.50.a: "Tashkent."
turkestan_events.50.b: "Stay in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."

turkestan_misc.200.t: "Mujahideen Kurbashi Arrives"
turkestan_misc.200.d: "After the defeat of the Mujahideen in his homeland, one of their Kushbegi and his loyalists crossed the border and came to us to lead our armed detachments"
turkestan_misc.200.a: "Great!"
turkestan_misc.200.b: "Send them away!"

turkestan_misc.201.t: "Bukharan Emir In Exile"
turkestan_misc.201.d: "After the abolition of monarchy in the Emirate of Bukhara, Mohammed Alim Khan, its Emir, was forced to exile in our country. Seems we have nothing to do, but to accept him gratefully for now."
turkestan_misc.201.a: "The last Emir of Bukhara?"

turkestan_misc.215.t: "[FROM.GetName] Buys Equipment"
turkestan_misc.215.d: "Today we were approached by the [FROM.GetAdjective] ministry of Defense, which asked us for supplies of equipment in order to help them modernize their obsolete Armed Forces. The deal was successful and we received our payment in time."
turkestan_misc.215.a: "Great!"
turkestan_misc.215.b: "Break the deal!"

turkestan_misc.216.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
turkestan_misc.216.d: "Unfortunately for us, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to establish an arms supply with us!"
turkestan_misc.216.a: "Sad..."

turkestan_misc.217.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agrees!"
turkestan_misc.217.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to establish an arms supply with us!"
turkestan_misc.217.a: "Great!"

UZB_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "After the Russian Civil War, the Central Asian region was left in chaos, desolated by feud and famine. Bukhara, led by Emir Mohammed Alim Khan, has managed to overcome the difficulties, but at the cost of internal stability. Various groups are breaking country apart, but they all want the same. Firstly, power and secondly, to unite the Turkestan into a single state."
TRK_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The republic of Kokand is has survived the Russian Civil War mainly with the help of Alash and the Whites. Today Kokand is the only independent democracy in the region, trying to maintain its position and restrain reactionary forces in the country. If Turkestan is united once, perhaps it will be a Central Asian Democracy."
KHI_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The existence of Khanate of Khiva has been more or less guaranteed by its stronger neighbour of Bukhara. Since 1918 the Khanate was ruled by a military dictator, Vizier Junaid-Khan. But his health becoming worse and worse with country risking a chance of ceasing to exist without its charismatic leader."
