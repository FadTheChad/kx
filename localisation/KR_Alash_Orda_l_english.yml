POLITICS_ALIKHAN_BUKEIKHANOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! March 5th, 1866, in Tokraunskaya volost, Semipalatinsk Oblast, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Älihan Bökeihan, or as he is better known in Petrograd, Alikhan Bukeykhanov, was a part of the Kazakh upper class from birth - he was a direct descendant of the khans of the Bukei Horde, an autonomous Kazakh state which surrendered to the Russians in the 19th century. He acquired his higher education in St. Petersburg and grew up influenced by Kadet liberalism and moderate socialism - ultimately, this drew him to become a member of the Kadets. However, as he was a diligent campaigner for Kazakh autonomy, after the February Revolution Bökeihan ceased to find support among the Kadets in this most important issue for him. In July 1917, the Alash party was founded with Bökeihan as its leader - a liberal, progressive and national party of all Kazakhs.\n\nAfter the civil war, the Alash autonomy was finally confirmed as an autonomous territory of Russia, and Älihan became the Minister-President of its local parliament, basically ruling as a governor of the autonomy. All this time he remained in office, supported by both the central government in Petrograd and the local parliament. In recent years, however, the aging ruler has more than once considered leaving office, but the only thing that seems to be holding him at his place is the party he created, which has split into various factions over the years and risks dissolution in case he retires."
POLITICS_MIRJAKIP_DULATULY_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! November 25th, 1885, in Sarykopinsk volost, Turgai Oblast, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Mirjaqyp Dulatuly. A very charismatic political presence but he is in many ways the perfect embodiment of the Alash Orda’s personality cults, and cliquishness. Dulatuly was floated as Bökeihan’s successor, but his radical liberalism and strong personal base of power alienated many others in the party, which saw Dulatuly snubbed in favour of the far more manipulatable and weak willed Yermekov. Dulatuly is to the left of the status quo, but he is still fundamentally a liberal and whilst his desire to end the political cliques in the Orda may seem noble, it is more that he simply seeks to supplant them with his own following."
POLITICS_ALIBI_JANGILDIN_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1884, in aul Qoyadul, Turgai Oblast, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! The first Kazakh revolutionary Bolshevik Alibi Dzhangildin was born in 1884 in Turgai region in a poor family, twice ran away from home to get an education, studied in spiritual consistory in Orenburg. In 1905 he was expelled from the Moscow Academy for revolutionary activity. Then Alibi Dzhangildin advertised in newspapers that he was going to walk around the whole Earth and was looking for companions. Two young men responded to the call - Polevoy, a St. Petersburg industrial engineer, and Korovin, a teacher at the Moscow Commercial Institute. In 1910 they set out on the road, however, soon his companions stayed in Hungary, and Alibi himself crossed Serbia, Turkey, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, India, Ceylon, Indochina, Japan. He earned a living by photography. Four years later, Djangildin returned home. It is Alibi who is often called the first Kazakh traveler, our Marco Polo.\n\nIn 1915, Alibi Dzhangildin became the first Kazakh Bolshevik, a year later, together with Amangeldy Imanov, raised an armed rebellion against the tsarist government, which lasted until the February Revolution. After it, Alibi Dzhangildin went to Petrograd, where he learned a little agitation, having received a certificate from the Bolsheviks to conduct propaganda. However, in Turgai, where he came to spread Bolshevik ideas, he was arrested for two months on the orders of the Provisional Government's regional commissar Alikhan Bukeikhanov.\n\nIn January 1918 Alibi Dzhangildin promised Stalin, then People's Commissar for Nationalities, that he could undermine the efforts of the Alash-Orda to establish autonomy. On May 14, 1918 Dzhangildin was appointed emergency military commissar of the Steppe region. In the summer of 1918 Dzhangildin was given 68 million rubles of aid for Turkestan and Turgai region, as well as weapons, ammunition, medicines, clothing. In August 1918, at the height of the Civil War, the detachment with the cargo boarded the schooners “Abbasin” and “Mehli” in Astrakhan, crossed the Caspian Sea, but the port was occupied by the Whites, so they had to land on a deserted shore and go through Mangyshlak. Periodically the caravan was attacked by the whites, several dozen people were killed. For 57 days the detachment passed more than three thousand kilometers, and on November 11 delivered weapons, medicines and ammunition for the Reds fighting on the Aktobe-Turkestan front."

It emerged from the reaction of Kazakh intelligentsia, dissatisfied with the program of Alash party, their ideas were a combination of ideology of Russian SRs and Islamic traditional movements. Nevertheless, the Üsh-Jüzovites enjoyed very little popularity and soon became disillusioned with the Provisional Government and were supported by the Bolsheviks.\nAfter the defeat of the Reds, a new chapter in the history of the party began. One of the party members, part-time head of the cultural society \"Jas Kazakh\", a national teacher, poet and writer, Saken Seyfullin, secured his election as party leader.

ALO_Land_Reform: "Modernize Land Tenure System"
ALO_Land_Reform_desc: "Although land use in the aul was formally communal and tribal, and land was nationalized, the bai semi-feudals owned the best meadow and arable lands. They leased out many arable lands and meadows. Under the guise of helping a kin, the bai gave cattle for temporary use to a poor man with the condition that the latter, receiving a part of milk and wool, took good care of the cattle, took care of increasing their fatness, and watched over the litter. For his “favor” the bai interfered in the life of the poor man and his family and forced them to work for him for free. A common form of bai exploitation was “supryaga” (“urtachestvo”). A poor man who did not have his own working cattle or seeds entered into “suppryaga” with a bai. The bai gave the poor man working cattle or seeds, and the poor man was obliged to give half or sometimes two-thirds of the harvest to the bai. The latter was not interested in the transition to cultural methods of farming, in the application of new techniques and agronomic achievements. Neither could the poor peasant crushed by need start such innovations. Therefore, the agriculture of Kazakhstan developed extremely slowly. Unliquidated patriarchal-feudal relations constrained productive forces"

The conduct of the three-level biy courts, the limitation of legal powers turned it into an administrative institution of the colonial power of the Russian Empire in the Kazakh steppe. Despite all the progressive reforms, the Biy court, always disinterested and fair, remained the main source of law and dispute resolution.

Despite the fact that the coup failed, Dutov wanted to follow Krasnov's example and declare Orenburg's independence. However, the Russian government made concessions and transferred Orenburg to the Alash autonomy, imposing Cossack autonomy on our country and securing its southern borders. All this has led to the fact that the Cossacks are actually running Orenburg, oppressing the local population in every possible way and periodically threatening our government. As long as we are weak and completely dependent on Russia, we cannot do anything with the violent Cossacks."

In some areas where the Qazaq population traditionally predominated, Russian settlers have since become the majority. Although the land was nationalized by the Bolsheviks, which led to the Black Repatrition - a mass land seizures by peasants, in Qazaq lands many settlers defended their right to own land. In the auls the land was already under communal management, though the Bai semi-feudals owned the best meadows and arable lands.\nAfter all, while Alash leaders sought land rights, the Russian authorities blocked it. Today, reclaiming land is paramount, necessitating resolution of settler conflicts and restoration of Qazaq ownership."

The events of the 1916 Revolt, a tapestry woven with both nightmares and tales of heroism, resonate across the nations. Yet, the bitter memory of its failure and the ensuing consequences fuels the flames of Qazaq nationalism. We must ensure that the specter of such senseless bloodshed never haunts our land again."

### Events ###
alash.1.t: "White Sun of the Desert"
alash.1.d: "Alash Autonomy emerged immediately after the Bolshevik putsch in Petrograd and the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly at the dawn of 1918. In fact, Alash autonomy was not an instant decision; it was the culmination of decades of colonialism and the bitter scars uncovered by the Central Asian uprising of 1916. Alash-Orda rose as a regional force, becoming an important player in the civil war, agreeing to the bitter conditions imposed by the White Government of Kolchak.\n\nAfter the war ended, a special relationship developed between local Kazakh leaders and the new republican government in Petrograd. Alash-Orda was never conceived as a separatist movement; it was a modernist movement, a reaction to the obsolete tsarist bureaucracy and the slow decline of Kazakh culture under the influence of the Russian boot.\n\nWith a more liberal government in control of Russia, the Alash Orda (whose key members were mostly Kadets) forged the necessary alliances and struck the necessary deals to achieve a degree of self-government."
alash.1.a: "Interesting"

alash.899.t: "Alash Party & Halyq Keńesi"
alash.899.d: "Since 1917, the country has been ruled by Älihan Bökeihan, leader of the Alash Party, a close associate of Kerensky, the father of the Kazakh state. The country's parliament is the Halyq Keńesi, or People's Council, largely modeled on the Russian Duma. Elections are synchronized with the Russian elections, and the Minister-President of Alash Autonomy is appointed by the parliament. For many years, the People's Council has remained virtually one-party, as the Alash Party leads the parliament nearly undisputed.\n\nAmong the opposition to the ruling regime are Jas Azamat - formerly the youth branch of Alash, but now a full-fledged social-democrat party with little representation in the parliament; the Ush Juz - affiliated with Left and center-left Russian SRs; and the Orenburg Cossacks - having their target quotas in the National Council based on the 1926 Orenburg Treaty."
alash.899.a: "Wake up, Qazaq!"

alash.898.t: "Dutov's Firm Hand Over Orenburg"
alash.898.d: "When Kolchak's putsch struck Russia in 1925, the Orenburg Cossacks initially opposed Kerensky's regime, together with the Don and Kuban Cossacks. However, Kerensky was able to convince the pragmatic Dutov to lay down his arms by offering Orenburg a special autonomous status. The situation was aggravated by the fact that the Kazaks, who had long claimed the Orenburg province, finally got it... but with Dutov and the Cossacks in tow. \n\nAll this led to the fact that we have virtually no control over Western Kazakstan, and Dutov had already spread his influence informally to Uralsk. The Orenburg Cossacks are also causing a lot of problems in the People's Council and are also actively involved in colonization to the East. There are even rumors reaching the central government that the local Kazakh population is being driven out of their ancestral territories, which the Cossacks are occupying."
alash.898.a: "Something must be done."

alash.897.t: "Assassination of President Kerensky"
alash.897.d: "Alarming news reached our capital from Petrograd, where a few hours ago President Kerensky, a friend and associate of Älihan Bökeihan, an associate and great supporter of Alash autonomy, who had done much for federal Russia, was killed.\n\nThe terrorist murderer should undoubtedly pay for his deeds, but it seems that Kerensky was the one who was able to hold the delicate balance of Russian politics in his hands, and now everything has gone into tatters. While chaos reigns in Russia, the Alash autonomy has declared mourning for the Russian president and has lowered both Russian and Alash flags."
alash.897.a: "He can be criticized, but could you be in his shoes?"

alash.896.t: "Dutov Makes His Move"
alash.896.d: "Along with the chaos reigning in Russia, the control over our autonomy weakened, and it was not us, as one would expect, but the notorious Orenburg Cossacks who decided to take advantage of it.\n\nYesterday, leaving their cozy fiefdom in Orenburg, the Cossacks actually established power over the Urals, claiming that the territories of the abolished Urals Cossack Army should also receive wide autonomy. Before their power spreads to the entire region, and in particular to the town of [ALO_guryev_kazakh], action must be taken. Without the patronage of President Kerensky, it will be difficult to come to an agreement with the Cossacks and keep them from committing crimes against our statehood and territorial integrity."
alash.896.a: "Another city lost to cossacks!"

alash.895.t: "Rumors of Älihan Bökeihan's Resignation"
alash.895.d.death: "Today rumors reached the government of the Alash Orda that Älihan Bökeihan, deeply saddened by the death of his friend... President Kerensky, and also probably taking his age into account, intends to resign, for the first time allowing a new man to take the honorable place of Minister-President of the young Kazakh democracy.\n\nSo far, however, there has been no official confirmation of such information, but rumors soon leaked out to the media, and many Kazaks read in the morning papers that the father of the nation was preparing to leave his post.\n\nIn a sense, the unprecedented excitement over such news prompted members of the media to contact the government for comment, after which a press release was announced at which Bökeihan was scheduled to speak.\n\nOn the appointed morning, a conference of the most influential acting ministers was assembled, headed by Älihan Bökeihan himself, who announced the beginning of a new era for the Alash autonomy. The Father of the Nation spoke at length about the possibilities for modernizing and improving the living conditions of ordinary Kazaks, and finally, at the end of his speech, made an important announcement, finally putting an end to all the rumors surrounding his resignation."

# Russia goes Snap Elections #
alash.893.t: "Extraordinary Elections Announced!"
alash.893.d: "In connection with the death of President Kerensky, general elections were announced in Russia, and our autonomy, as part of a federal republic, was also obliged to hold them. Usually the Kazakh population predominantly voted for the Alash party, and we even won a significant number of deputies in the all-Russian Duma, but in recent years, due to the growing popularity of Üsh-Jüz and Jas Azamat, which form unified lists with candidates from Russian parties, our majoritarianism was lost.\n\nIn general, the interest of the Kazakh population to the all-Russian elections has faded, and the turnout is quite low, but the Russians and Cossack migrants vote for Russian parties, and in recent years their support has changed towards right-wing nationalist parties, such as NRPR and VNS. We must keep an eye on these elections and not allow non-indigenous Russians to represent our autonomy in the Russian parliament."
alash.893.a: "Let us hope Russia won't fall into electoral nightmare"

alash.892.t: "Alash Party Primaries" # -> alash.888
alash.892.d: "In connection with Bökeihan's resignation and the scheduling of elections to the Halyq Keńesi in the near future, the Alash Party convened a congress to elect a candidate from the party who would become prime minister and form the government.\n\nIn recent years, the party has lost much in unity and cohesion, and is now in fact no longer a party but a coalition of political cliques. On the left flank, the Alash party is represented by a group of politicians who did not leave the party after the formation of Jas Azamat, united under the leadership of Jahansha Dosmukhamedov. They are quite radical in their policy, intending to reform the party from within and drastically change inequality.\n\nThe progressive wing of the party is represented by Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, a close associate of Bökeihan, who was predicted to be his successor, but his radical liberalism and strong personal power base alienated the more moderate Alash members, who preferred the more pragmatic Yermekov.\n\nThe moderate centrists are represented precisely by him, Bökeihan's "named" successor, who has secured the support of the Alash Party establishment, and who serves as the "voice of Reason" of the party. Politicians who want to preserve the status quo and are afraid of rocking the boat are united around him.\n\nFinally, opposed on the right is Sadyq Amanjolov - the creator of the People's Militia of the Alash Orda, a military leader and defender of the Kazakh people, a nationalist who advocates the development of the army and finally the separation from Russia, prophesied by the Central Asian uprising of 1916."
alash.892.a: "Jahansha Dosmukhamedov, Alash Party's leftist."
alash.892.b: "Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, radical liberal."
alash.892.c: "Älimhan Yermekov, follower of Bökeihan's vision."
alash.892.e: "Sadyq Amanjolov, Kazakh nationalist."

# Russia goes Civil War or Revolution #

alash.890.t: "Revolution in Russia"
alash.890.d: "Revolution happens in Russia, and now it becomes obvious that we should cut our ties with the treacherous socialist government, that fought against our independence in the first civil war. However, the question arises if we should stay loyal to the Russian Volunteer Army, led by Lavr Kornilov, the government, based in Volgograd. While their government is likely to fight for united and indivisible Russia, we have previously agreed to become an autonomy."
alash.890.a: "Announce our support for Kornilov's regime!" #-> Rise of Kenes (wneh civil war starts)

alash.889.b: "A dangerous result."

# United Front failure #

alash.888.t: "Alash Unity Under Threat"
alash.888.d: "The once united Alash party has long since cracked, but now the split has only intensified after a candidate from a single bloc of political cliques was elected in the primaries. All factions, except for the winning one, were dissatisfied with the results, and are already openly declaring distrust of the Alash Central Committee and the new candidate. \n\nSupporters of the winning candidate assure that only Älihan Bökeihan can save the situation, who should name a successor himself and thereby unite the party, probably for the last time, but skeptics state that the party unity died once and for all, and nothing will help him, so it is easier to just admit it as a fact."
alash.888.a: "The unity of the party has died out."
alash.888.b: "Bökeihan should intervene and name a successor!"

alash.887.t: "Bökeihan Names His Successor"
alash.887.d: "Älihan Bökeihan spoke today at a meeting of the Alash Central Committee with intentions to announce his successor - which from a formal legal point of view, of course, does not change the situation in any way, and the candidate elected in the primaries will remain in his place. It is the symbolic importance of Älihan that will be important, and perhaps in this way the candidate he names will be able to gain popularity with the people and seize the initiative in the future.\n\nNevertheless, the name named will hardly come as a surprise to everyone. Earlier, Bökeihan worked closely with Dulatuly, but times have changed and for the past six years another party member, Älimhan Yermekov, has firmly established a nickname of successor. That is why, when the aged father of the nation uttered the cherished name, the delegates did not breathe a sigh of relief, but only realized that the time of struggle had just begun. Yermekov did become the named successor of Bökeihan, but whether it would somehow affect the unity of the party - rather for the worse."
alash.887.a: "There are doubts that it can heal the wounds of the party"

alash.886.t: "The Race Starts" #-> alash.885
alash.886.d: "After the primaries and the beginning of the active campaign of the party, the campaign was actually sabotaged by members from other factions. Party unity is practically at zero, but those who disagree with the results of the vote for a candidate are outraged and do not seem to allow him to be elected.\n\nThat is why in fact all 4 candidates took part in the race for the Prime Minister's seat and deployed their campaign headquarters.\n\nJahansha Dosmukhamedov, Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, Älimhan Yermekov and Sadyq Amanjolov - for the first time 4 candidates were nominated from Alash party and for the first time it was not Älihan Bökeihan. These elections promise to be interesting, but the most frightening thing for Alash, which held power for many years, is whether such clear split in the party is a tidbit and good timing for the opposition, which is increasing its power and offers people an alternative. Alternative, which for the first time may be more promising than current system."

alash.885.t: "'Battle' For [ALO_guryev_kazakh]"
alash.885.d: "The region of [ALO_guryev_kazakh] finds itself at the heart of a political struggle. This area serves as the stronghold of the western wing of Alash, led by Jansha Dosmukhamedov. However, Jansha's influence is threatened as the Center of the party hesitates to fully support him. The local Cossack presence is strong, raising concerns about the potential dominance of their interests in the region.\n\nThe nationalist wing of Alash proposes a decisive move to secure victory. They advocate for the introduction of militia troops into [ALO_guryev_kazakh], a measure that could guarantee the triumph of the Alash cause. Yet, this approach comes at a price, as it involves resorting to undemocratic measures."
alash.885.a: "The Western wing of Alash gets the support of Center" #-> Jansha wins, aligns with Dulatuly

alash.884.d: "The strategic decision to withhold support from the western wing of Alash has now manifested as a concrete outcome. Ataman Dutov and his Cossacks have capitalized on the absence of assistance and have successfully solidified their control over the region of [ALO_guryev_kazakh]. Their influence has grown, and they have managed to secure a significant victory in this pivotal area.\n\nThe lack of intervention has given the Cossacks the upper hand, allowing them to bolster their position and potentially reshape the political landscape in their favor."

Jansha Dosmukhamedov, the leader of the western wing of Alash, has taken a momentous step. In response to the altered dynamics, he has chosen to sever ties with the Alash party coalition and form an alliance with the oppositional social-democratic party Jas Azamat."

alash.882.t: "Alash Secures Electoral Victory in [ALO_guryev_kazakh]"
alash.882.d: "The calculated decision to provide support to the western wing of Alash has yielded a significant outcome. The party's efforts to strengthen its position in the region of [ALO_guryev_kazakh] have borne fruit, as they emerge victorious in the local elections.\n\nThis triumph not only reinforces Alash's influence in the region but also safeguards a vital stronghold against the encroaching dominance of the Cossacks. The successful election outcome serves as a testament to the effectiveness of strategic intervention in the political process."
alash.882.a: "Another stronghold against the cossacks."

alash.881.t: "Kazakh Nationalists Clash With Cossacks"
alash.881.d: "In the heart of [ALO_guryev_kazakh], a tumultuous clash of ideologies and ambitions plays out in vivid hues. Kazakh nationalists, fuelled by a passionate yearning for self-determination and the revival of their distinct cultural identity, find themselves locked in a fierce confrontation with the entrenched Cossack presence. The cobblestone streets, once pathways of shared heritage, now resonate with the echoes of discord as historical grievances and aspirations intermingle.\n\nThe air is charged with tension, grievances accumulated over generations converging into a volatile present. The scent of conflict is palpable as impassioned speeches reverberate through the squares, framing the battle as a struggle for the soul of [ALO_guryev_kazakh]. Beneath the surface, currents of history, nationalism, and power collide, shaping the very foundations of the region's future. As both sides rally their supporters and assert their right to shape the course of [ALO_guryev_kazakh], the outcome remains uncertain, weighed down by the weight of historical scars."

alash.879.t: "Russia Intervenes on the Dutov's Side"
alash.879.d: "A new phase begins as the power struggles within [ALO_guryev_kazakh] attract the attention of a larger player: Russia. With the weight of political calculation, Russia intervenes on the side of Dutov and his steadfast Cossacks, casting a mantle of influence over the region. \n\nThe move by Russia is more than mere intervention; it's a statement that reverberates across the region and beyond. The choices and allegiances of those within [ALO_guryev_kazakh] ripple through the currents of international relations, highlighting the interconnectedness of even seemingly localized struggles. As the spotlight of international scrutiny shines on the region, alliances are cemented, rivalries kindled, and the stakes raised to unprecedented heights."

alash.878.t: "Russia Forced Dutov to Withdraw"
alash.878.d: "Amidst the complex tangle of interests and alliances, a turn of events is set in motion as external pressures bear down on Dutov and his Cossacks. Under the shadow of international maneuvering, Dutov's grip on [ALO_guryev_kazakh] weakens, marking a pivotal moment in the region's political evolution. The choices and confrontations that have defined the struggle for control now intersect with the broader currents of geopolitical strategy.\n\nThe orchestration of Dutov's withdrawal is an intricate dance of diplomacy and coercion, revealing the extent to which external powers can shape the internal dynamics of a nation. As the curtain falls on Dutov's influence in [ALO_guryev_kazakh], a vacuum is left in his wake, a void that sparks both new possibilities and a heightened sense of uncertainty. The echoes of this momentous shift will ripple through the region, altering the trajectories of individuals, factions, and the very destiny of [ALO_guryev_kazakh]."
alash.878.a: "Kazakh Nationalists secure [ALO_guryev_kazakh]"

The streets that once bore the footprints of passionate rallies are now gripped by an eerie stillness, the vibrant debates giving way to the iron fist of authority.\n\nThe corridors of power pulse with tension as leaders grapple with the implications of this draconian measure. The declaration of martial law casts a long shadow, its implications echoing through the region's history and foreshadowing the sacrifices necessary to maintain order. The very essence of [ALO_guryev_kazakh]'s democratic process is at stake, prompting questions about the balance between stability and the fundamental rights of its citizens. In this moment of fraught decision-making, the future of [ALO_guryev_kazakh] teeters on a precipice, its fate hanging in the balance between control and chaos."

The region's most popular politician, engineer Mukhametjan Tynyshbayuly is running as the [589.GetName]'s candidate from the Alash party, but without support from the Center, it is likely he will try to align the nationalists or even completely lose the race to the Jas Azamat. While we must remember that the region is quite unstable, being on the border with Turkestan, as well as hosting Semirechye Cossacks. If we get it out of our control, it can cost us yet another problems. It is suggested to force Tynyshbayuly to end his race and support one of the Alash centrist candidates, and in return he will be given the prestige chair of the Minister of Economy."

alash.798.d: "During the election campaign, Mukhametjan Tynyshbayuly was offered a place in the government if during his campaign in [589.GetName] he will support the Alash Center. Eventually, he significantly increased chances for our victory in this strategically important region and we will forever be grateful. Despite Tynyshbayuly is generally said to be a centrist, he is close to the Alash nationalists. Perhaps, now we have greater chance to find a common ground with Amanjolov, even though the leftist faction, especially the Western wing, will dissaprove of this."

alash.797.t: "Ministry of Modernisation Sets Ambitious Deadlines"
alash.797.d: "The Ministry of Modernization has taken a bold initiative to address the key challenges facing Alash-Orda. Recognizing the urgent need for change, in an unprecedented move, the Ministry of Modernization is announcing a series of deadlines to address some of the most pressing issues.\n\n1 Year Deadline: Addressing illiteracy.\nRecognizing that access to education is fundamental to the country's progress, the Ministry of Modernization is committed to eliminating illiteracy in all regions of Alash-Orda within one year. As part of this initiative, schools will be established, teachers trained and educational resources distributed to ensure that every citizen, regardless of background or circumstances, has the opportunity to acquire the necessary literacy skills.\n\n2 Year Deadline: Addressing the problem of Russian settlers.\nAddressing the complex problem of Russian settlers in the territories of Kazakhstan, the Ministry of Modernization sets a two-year deadline to resolve tensions and create a fair land law.\n\n3 Year Deadline: Transition to a sedentary lifestyle\nWith a bold vision for the future, the Ministry of Modernization sets a three-year deadline to facilitate the transition of nomadic Kazakh tribes to a sedentary lifestyle. Through targeted infrastructure investments, vocational training programs, and economic incentives, the Ministry aims to enable nomadic populations to settle in permanent settlements and engage in sustainable agriculture."
alash.797.a: "We must do whatever it takes to achieve these goals."
alash.797.b: "So, they are planning to do this on their own?"

alash.796.t: "Question of the Biy Courts"
alash.796.d: "The centuries-old institution of Biy courts, deeply rooted in Kazakh traditions and culture, has come under scrutiny in connection with the planned judicial reforms. As a result of the Russian judicial reform of 1864, the Biy courts largely lost their traditional importance as a legal institution, ceding administrative functions to colonial rule. Despite these changes, the Biy courts are still the basis for legal regulation and dispute resolution in Kazakh society.\n\nNow that Alash Orda needs to modernize and strengthen the legal system, it has to decide what to do with the Biy courts. One idea is to regulate their activities by the state, which would keep their traditional role but also subject them to supervision and control. Proponents say this respects Kazakhs cultural heritage and maintains continuity in the legal system. However, some people think that the government regulating the Biy courts could make them less independent and impartial, which would make them less effective at providing fair justice. Also, it would be hard to regulate these courts because they are decentralized and informal, which would create lots of logistical and administrative problems.\n\nAnother option is that Alash Orda might decide to completely get rid of the Biy courts and replace them with a modern system of civil courts. People who support this idea say that civil courts are more transparent and follow legal standards better. However, some people think that getting rid of the Biy courts completely could make some people feel left out. Also, setting up civil courts would take a lot of money and resources, which might be hard to find in a society that is still moving from a nomadic to a sedentary lifestyle."
alash.796.a: "Biy courts must remain."
alash.796.b: "Get rid of this survival of times past."

alash.795.t: "Regulation of Biy Courts"
alash.795.d: "While it was decided to keep the Biy courts, the government of Alash Orda has to come up with a way to regulate these traditional legal institutions. One idea is to create committees made up of legal experts, members of the public, and government officials. These committees will oversee the Biy courts and make sure that everything is done according to the law. They will also audit the Biy courts and judicial proceedings.\n\nAnother option is to codify the laws of Jeti Jarği, which will serve as a comprehensive legal basis for the trial of Biys. By formalizing the principles and procedures set out in the "Jeti Jarği", the government can standardize the judicial process and clarify the rights and obligations in legal disputes. Also, making the laws of Jeti Jarği official would make the decisions of the Biy courts more consistent and predictable, which would boost public confidence in the judicial system.\n\nAs a big step towards modernization, there's another option that would bring the Biy courts into the national judicial system of Alash-Orda. By putting the Biy courts under the jurisdiction of higher courts and legal institutions, the government is trying to make sure that everything is done the same way and that everyone follows the national laws and regulations."
alash.795.a: "Establish judicial oversight committees"
alash.795.b: "Codify the Jeti Jarği"
alash.795.c: "Integrate the biy courts into national judiciary."

alash.794.t: "Codification of Jeti Jarği Laws"
alash.794.d: "The Alash Orda government started putting together a set of laws based on the teachings of Jeti Jarği. In addition to these, there is also the codification of the “Code of Qasim Khan” and Esim Khan's ordinance, as well as the provisions of the congresses of biys - “Yerezhe”, and “Biler sezi” - stories containing information on the practice of the biys' court - judicial precedents. Together, the laws cover a wide range of topics, from land disputes to family matters.\n\nAccording to the proposed plan, a team of lawyers and scholars will be assembled to carefully study and document the laws of Jeti Jarği, highlighting key principles and procedures that will form the basis of a unified legal code. Rayymjan Marsekuly, one of the first professional lawyers of the Alash Orda and Chairman of the Alash-Qala Zemstvo, will lead the team. They'll use historical texts, oral traditions, and scientific research to capture the essence of Jeti Jarği and adapt it to modern society."
alash.794.a: "Great!"

alash.793.t: "Civil Code for Alash Orda"
alash.793.d: "The government has announced plans to adopt a comprehensive civil code that will replace the traditional Biy and Sharia courts. The Ministry of Modernization is pushing for a switch to Western models of jurisprudence and is considering adopting the Swiss Civil Code as the basis for its new legal framework. Alternatively, Alash Orda could turn to its historical ties with Russia and adopt the Russian Civil Code as the basis for its new legal code. For those who want to keep the cultural heritage and legal traditions of Kazakhstan, the codification of the laws of \"Jeti Jarği\" is a great alternative to Western or Russian legal models. By formalizing and modernizing traditional Kazakh laws, Alash Orda can create a unique legal code that reflects the values and norms of its society."
alash.793.a: "The Swiss civil code should be the base."
alash.793.b: "The Russian civil code will be more convenient for us."
alash.793.c: "Codify the Jeti Jarği"

alash.792.t: "Independent Muftiate for Alash Orda"
alash.792.d: "The idea of an independent Muftiate first emerged during the Second All-Qazaq Congress, where efforts to establish a separate religious institution for Kazakhs were thwarted by the influence of the Russian-controlled Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly. However, with the dawn of a new era of Alash sovereignty, the time has come to assert Kazakh control over religious matters and break free from external influence.\n\nUnder the proposed plan, the independent Muftiate for Alash Orda would serve as the supreme religious authority for the Kazakh people, responsible for overseeing religious practices, issuing religious rulings (fatwas), and administering religious institutions across the territory. The Mufti was also elected - Qabysh Berdalin, a famous Aqyn from Pavlodar region. He also headed the Pavlodar district branch of the Alash party. Led by a respected and knowledgeable Mufti, the Muftiate would uphold the principles of Islam.\n\nWhile the majority of ministers supported the establishment of the Muftiate, the leftist members, while endorsing this step towards independence, also criticized the decision for blurring the boundaries between church and state, calling for complete secularisation of the state."
alash.792.a: "Another colonial pillar is destroyed."

alash.791.t: "Office of Religious Affairs"
alash.791.d: "The Government has decided to establish the Office of Religious Affairs, a step against the growing concern about the influence of Qadimism and the need to promote secular values and tolerance in society. Although officially Alash Orda was formed as an autonomy within the Russian Republic and was secular according to Article 35 of the Constitution of the RDFR, the reality on the ground paints a more complex picture. Despite the constitutional provisions on secular governance, Islam continues to play a significant role in shaping social norms and traditions, and Sharia courts still operate in some regions. Moreover, the emergence of fundamentalist ideologies fueled by external influence from Turkestan poses a threat to the stability and progress of the Alash society.\n\nAccording to the proposed plan, the Office of Religious Affairs will serve as the central body responsible for overseeing all matters related to faith, worship and ethics in Alash Orda. The Office will actively promote secularism and tolerance in the Alash society, advocating the separation of religion from the state, while respecting the rights of individuals to freely profess their faith."
alash.791.a: "Another step towards modernization."

alash.790.t: "Reform of the Madrasas"
alash.790.d: "Jadidism, a reformist movement within the Islamic world, advocates for the modernization of education and the integration of Western scientific and technological advancements into traditional Islamic teachings. Originating in the late 19th century, Jadidism emerged as a response to the challenges posed by colonialism and the need to adapt Islamic education to the demands of the modern era. Under the government's plan, Jadid schools will receive increased support and resources to expand their reach and enhance the quality of education offered to students. Furthermore, the law will provide framework to spread New-Method teaching to all Madrasas of the country, potentially allowing to close any Qadimist madrasas.\n\nThe law is criticized by both the left and right - the left complain about lack of government funding for secular schools and public education for non-Muslims, while the right denigrate the government as apostates from the traditional Islamic faith."
alash.790.a: "Jadidism is the future of Islam."

alash.789.t: "Universal Public Education"
alash.789.d: "In a significant policy change aimed at modernizing the education system and promoting secular values, the Government of Alash Orda announced the creation of a comprehensive programme of universal public education and the establishment of a Ministry of National Education. Accessible and high-quality education for all citizens, regardless of their socio-economic status or cultural beliefs, is to be provided, while respecting secular norms and a Western approach to learning.\n\nUnder the new program, the Government will prioritize the development of a robust public education infrastructure that meets the diverse needs of the population and fosters a culture of intellectual growth, critical thinking, and social mobility. The Government will invest in expanding and improving public schools across the country, with a particular focus on increasing access to education in underserved areas and improving the quality of facilities, teaching staff and educational resources. A standardized curriculum based on secular principles and Western educational standards will be developed for implementation in all public schools. Comprehensive training programs will be organized for teachers to equip them with the pedagogical knowledge, teaching methods and subject matter expertise necessary to provide quality instruction in accordance with the new curriculum.\n\nWith regard to religious education, New-Method madrasas, both public and private, could be funded by religious entities through the Ministry of Education, while support for Qadimist and traditional madrasas would be suspended. Jadidism will be supported at the ministerial level, while maintaining the secularism of the state and actively sponsoring secularism.\n\nOf course, the measures have met resistance, largely from traditionalists and the right-wing in parliament, but these measures are necessary for the sake of modernization and development of the country."

alash.700.t: "Kenes Calls For Revolution"
alash.700.d: "With our decision to support the ROVS, a lot of oppositional parties, not only those who call for independence, but also those, who call for revolution, were outraged. The first signs of instability appeared in the north-eastern regions, where the proportion of workers is higher, in the mines of [404.GetName] and industrialized regions, such as [588.GetName]. The remnants of the Kazakh Bolsheviks, led by Alibi Jangildin and his 'Kenes' party started rallying for support and call for socialist revolution in all of [ROOT.GetName]. Not only the workers are joining those calls, but also Dehkans, who are against the dominance of wealthier farmers and smallholders. The organization of Qosshy has also supported the revolution. With the revolutionaries already starting to seize administrative buildings and form so-called 'Soviets', the situation is becoming dare."

The nationalist clique, however, is strongly opposed to this and claims that we should find inspiration in Ottoman Empire's reform and, as much of the Muslim World, adopt the Latin alphabet.

alash.23.t: "War in Central Asia"

alash.34.b: "Unfortunate..."

alash.35.t: "Independence for Alash Autonomy?"
alash.35.d: "The main issue, discussed at the Third All-Kazakh Congress was if Alash Autonomy should finally declare independence from Russia. While half of the ministers and senators claim that the time has come to throw off the chains of Russian oppression and end the farce of Alash-Orda being part of Russia, the other half, however, consisting mostly of ethnic Russians and Cossacks, believe that there will be no Kazakstan without Russian assistance."
alash.35.a: "No, we must remain loyal to Russia."
alash.35.b: "Declare full independence from Russia."

alash.43.t: "On the other side of Syr Darya"
alash.43.d: "On the opposite bank of the river Syr Darya lies the Islamic Federation of Turkestan - a reactionary and militarized country which shares common origins and culture with us.

alash.47.b: "Then we will force them to join us!"

alash.49.t: "Orenburg Cossack Host"
alash.49.d: "While Orenburg is not located in Alash Autonomy, the Ataman of Orenburg Cossacks, Dutov, is a close friend of Vasily Balabanov. He was one of the first political leaders in Russia to recognize our state and now his Cossack troops are disposed in Alash, securing our state. However, he did not recognize the leadership of Kerensky after the Civil War. The Kazakh army almost entirely depends on Cossacks and the assistance of Ataman Dutov is vital for our state. We should think of granting Cossack special status in Alash-Orda, the one that will be much higher than of a regular Kazakh."
alash.49.a: "Grant Special Status to Cossacks"

alash.57.t: "Union with [DKB.GetName]?"
alash.57.d: "The social class of cossacks, though always having special privelege from the Russian government, has been separated and humbled into the dust by the failed republican Russian government.

alash.57.a: "United we are stronger."

alash.58.t: "Union with [ALO.GetName]?"

alash.60.t: "An Offer from Ataman Dutov"
alash.60.d: "The government of Ataman Dutov has offered us an alliance against Petrograd regime."
alash.60.b: "Why should we die for this crazy Ataman?"
alash.60.c: "Orenburg Military District should be created."

alash.61.t: "Cossacks Overthrow Our Government!"
alash.61.d: "Our policy towards cossacks has angered their community in our country. Today, several armed cossack garrisons entered the capital city, led by Ataman Dutov. After a short battle with the local police force, he arrested the government and proclaimed himself dictator of the nation."
alash.61.a: "Long live Ataman Dutov!"

alash.62.t: "Offer From Vladivostok"
alash.62.d: "Kolchak suggested that we should become a 'Military District', recognizing Vladivostok's full authority over us."

alash.62.b: "We disagree."

alash.63.t: "Dutov Refused!"
alash.63.d: "This freedom-loving crazy Cossack refused to become our puppet. Well, now we should decide if we should mutually guarantee each other or forget about this pointless alliance."

alash.64.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has decisevely protested against Kazakhization, especially in Kyrgyz and Uzbek minorities areas in several our regions, most notably in [589.GetName]. We can refuse politely or outright say that we will do anything we want on our territories."
alash.64.a: "Kazakhization will stay as it is."
alash.64.b: "Fine, let the Kyrgyz stay away from it."

alash.65.t: "[FROM.GetName] Ends Kazakhization in [589.GetName]"
alash.65.d: "The Alash government has decided to end Kazakhization in regions with significant Kyrgyz minority because of friendly relations between our countries."
alash.65.a: "Nice"

alash.66.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused to Stop Kazakhization!"
alash.66.d: "The traitorous Alash government refused to end Kazakhization in regions with significant Kyrgyz minority, greatly damaging our relations."
alash.66.a: "Try to seize [589.GetName]"
alash.66.b: "We are too weak now to answer them."

alash.100.t: "Join [SOV.GetNameDefCap]?"
alash.100.d: "The recent victories of socialists in Russian and Kazakstan have shown close ties between our countries. The new government of Kazakstan believes that we should join [SOV.GetName] in our common struggle against imperalists and capitalists."
alash.100.a: "Join the Big Brother"

alash.200.t: "[FROM.GetName] Claims Our Territories"
alash.200.d.puppet: "The government of [FROM.GetName] has claimed some of the bordering territories, which has a significant minority of Kazakhs. We can meet our Kazakh friends halfway and separate these territories from our country, effectively transferring the regions under the control of the [FROM.GetAdjective] government. On the other hand, we can maintain these regions under our formal control and increase Kazakh autonomy in these territories, allowing national-cultural autonomy in some way. Nevertheless, we can always just outright deny their request."
alash.200.d: "The government of [FROM.GetName] has claimed some of the bordering territories, which has a significant minority of Kazakhs. Despite the fact that the Kazakhs have decided to declare their independence, we can try to find advantages in their offer and bring them back under our control. Firstly, we can exchange these territories in response to the conclusion of a contract for the supply of a large percentage of their harvest on preferential terms. Secondly, we can directly offer them to rejoin Russia on the rights of broad autonomy, and then the issue of land transfer will be only a formality."
alash.200.a: "Let them have it for free."
alash.200.b: "Create a national-cultural autonomy in these regions."
alash.200.c: "We must have a proportion of their harvest instead."
alash.200.e: "Only if they once again become our autonomy."
alash.200.f: "Just deny their request."

alash.201.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
alash.201.d: "To our great surprise, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to hand over the territories we claimed. This is a great victory for our nation!"

alash.202.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Offer"
alash.202.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to fully transfer these territories, but instead they offered to create a wide national-cultural autonomy in the territories we claimed."

alash.204.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Demands"
alash.204.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to fully transfer these territories unless we sign an economic treaty, that will grant the [FROM.GetAdjective]s almost half of our yield. While this will put us under certain level of dependency on [FROM.GetName], at least we will have our ethnic territories."
alash.204.a: "Sure..."
alash.204.b: "That's nonsense!"

alash.205.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
alash.205.d: "To our great surprise, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to sign the treaty. Now they are again under our dependence, even if they not fully undestand these. Let them have these territories."
alash.205.a: "Great!"

alash.206.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
alash.206.d: "Unfortunately, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused our terms. That means that they won't have their lands as well."
alash.206.a: "We will get them later."

alash.207.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Our Submission In Exchange!"
alash.207.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to return our territories only if we once again become their autonomy. Even if this will piss off literally every citizen, we will receive protection and territories."
alash.207.a: "We will never become their puppet again!"
alash.207.b: "If this is the price..."

alash.208.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"

alash.212.t: "Russian Influence Increased"
alash.212.d: "Russian influence over our country due to the Treaty of Kostanai has increased a lot, with us becoming heavily dependent on the Russians. It seems that now nothing can stop Russia from thoroughly integrating us into their country!"

alash.220.t: "Elections to the Russian Parliament"
alash.220.d: "Since the Alash Autonomy is part of a Federation with Russia, we have representation in the Russian Parliament.\n\nIn connection with the early elections to the Russian Parliament, elections are also being held on the territory of Alash.

alash.300.t: "Third All-Kazakh Congress"
alash.300.d: "The Russian Republic is in chaos,society is radicalizing and the economy is falling. Älihan Bökeihan has announced that the Third All-Kazakh Congress should be held immediately in order to solve some up to date issues. On the one hand, Älihan is hoping to finally break away from Russia and secure Kazakh independence. But on the other hand, cutting ties with Russia can lead to serious problems, both political and economical. Moreover, being almost 70 years old, Bökeihan is thinking of retirement and quiet rest somewhere near the Balkash lake. There are also talks about the retirement of the old leader in the government, especially amongs the Young Alash wing of the party. But the instability, which can be caused by retirement can play a joke on us and let the most radical factions seize the power."
alash.300.a: "We must choose wisely."

alash.301.t: "Society Radicalized"
alash.301.d: "The decision of Bökeihan to remain loyal to Russia has provoked a massive unrest among the delegates. Moreover, the socialist party of QTKP is looking forward to use the instability to seize the power and the Orenburg Cossacks, led by Dutov, are ready to establish a firm hand rule if needed."

alash.302.t: "The Delegates Demand Resignation Of Bökeihan"
alash.302.d: "The Delegates believe that Bökeihan is too old to handle the power in his hands. His decision to remain loyal to Russia has been a devastating choice and perhaps the worst way to end the career. Everything depends on Bökeihan now."

alash.305.t: "Resignation?"

ALO_Wounds_Of_Alash: "Healing the Wounds of Alash"
ALO_Wounds_Of_Alash_desc: "In recent years, the §mAlash§! party has lost much in unity and cohesion, and is now in fact no longer a party but a coalition of political cliques. On the left flank, the §mAlash§! party is represented by a group of politicians who did not leave the party after the formation of Jas Azamat, united under the leadership of §OJahansha Dosmukhamedov§!. They are quite radical in their policy, intending to reform the party from within and drastically change inequality.\nThe progressive wing of the party is represented by §lMirjaqyp Dulatuly§!, a close associate of Bökeihan, who was predicted to be his successor, but his radical liberalism and strong personal power base alienated the more moderate Alash members, who preferred the more pragmatic §GÄlimhan Yermekov§!.\nThe moderate centrists are represented precisely by him, who has secured the support of the Alash Party establishment, and who serves as the \"voice of Reason\" of the party. Politicians who want to preserve the status quo and are afraid of rocking the boat are united around him.\nFinally, opposed on the right is §cSadyq Amanjolov§! - the creator of the People's Militia of the Alash Orda, a military leader and defender of the Kazakh people, a nationalist who advocates the development of the army and finally the separation from Russia, prophesied by the Central Asian uprising of 1916.\n\nCurrent §mAlash§!
