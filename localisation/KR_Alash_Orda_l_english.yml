POLITICS_ALIKHAN_BUKEIKHANOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! March 5th, 1866, in Tokraunskaya volost, Semipalatinsk Oblast, General Government of the Steppes, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Älihan Bökeihan, or as he is better known in Petrograd, Alikhan Bukeykhanov, was a part of the Qazaq upper class from birth - he was a direct descendant of the khans of the Bukei Horde, an autonomous Qazaq state which surrendered to the Russians in the 19th century. He acquired his higher education in St. Petersburg and grew up influenced by Kadet liberalism and moderate socialism - ultimately, this drew him to become a member of the Kadets. However, as he was a diligent campaigner for Qazaq autonomy, after the February Revolution Bökeihan ceased to find support among the Kadets in this most important issue for him. In July 1917, the Alash party was founded with Bökeihan as its leader - a liberal, progressive and national party of all Qazaqs.\n\nAfter the civil war, the Alash autonomy was finally confirmed as an autonomous territory of Russia, and Älihan became the Minister-President of its local parliament, basically ruling as a governor of the autonomy. All this time he remained in office, supported by both the central government in Petrograd and the local parliament. In recent years, however, the aging ruler has more than once considered leaving office, but the only thing that seems to be holding him at his place is the party he created, which has split into various factions over the years and risks dissolution in case he retires."
POLITICS_MIRJAKIP_DULATULY_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! November 25th, 1885, in Sarykopinsk volost, Turgay Oblast, General Government of the Steppes, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Mirjaqyp Dulatuly. A very charismatic political presence but he is in many ways the perfect embodiment of the Alash Orda’s personality cults, and cliquishness. Dulatuly was floated as Bökeihan’s successor, but his radicalism and strong personal base of power alienated many others in the party, which saw Dulatuly snubbed in favour of the far more manipulatable and weak willed Yermekov. Dulatuly is to the left of the status quo, but he is still fundamentally a liberal and whilst his desire to end the political cliques in the Orda may seem noble, it is more that he simply seeks to supplant them with his own following."
POLITICS_SMAGUL_SADUAQASOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! November 1900, in Jarqyn aul, Akmolinsk Oblast, General Government of the Steppes, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Smagul Säduaqasov has received education in Russian-Qazaq school in 1915 and pursued further education at the Omsk Agricultural School. Alongside his studies, he began his career as a people's teacher in his native aul. In 1916 he became an active member of the Qazaq youth organization \"Birlik\" in Omsk, Akmolinsk Oblast - the direct predecessor of the Jas Azamat. The right-wing members of \"Birlik\" supported Alash Orda, and united to form Jas Azamat. This new organization was dedicated to the ideals of freedom and independence for the Qazaq people, as well as protection of the poor and social reforms. As a leader of this youth organization, Säduaqasov launched the newspaper of the same name, and later made Jas Azamat into official youth wing of the Alash party. He became even closer to the Alash leadership after he married Älihan Bökeihan's daughter Zeinep (Yelizaveta) in 1924. Together with her he moved to Tashkent in Turkestan, where they lived until 1927, returning to the Alash Autonomy afterwards. Smagul continued his political career, and was elected to the Halyq Kenesi - becoming one of the youngest members. In the beginning of the 1930s Jas Azamat became its own party, in a way, setting off a time bomb of the Alash party collapse. By 1936 he became one of the party's loudest critics, despite his family ties to the party's leadership."
POLITICS_ALIMKHAN_YERMEKOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! May 25th, 1891, in Qarqaraly, Semipalatinsk Oblast, General Government of the Steppes, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Älimhan Yermekov is known to many as voice of reason, a mathematician and skilled diplomat. Born to a middle class family, he received education in Tomsk, but had to stop his studies in order to join the Qazaq national-liberation movement. He became close to Älihan Bökeihan and was elected to Alash Orda's People's Council. After the war, he founded a school in his hometown, where he became headmaster and teacher of mathematics, as well as graduating from Tomsk university with diploma of a mining engineer and a specialty of a geological prospector. He returned to politics in late 1920s and soon became one of the closest allies of Bökeihan, and in situation of fractured party, he was an unapologetic supporter of the status quo. Now, becoming Bökeihan's successor, he's willing to preserve Alash Orda with its unique culture, but acknowleding the need for modernization."
POLITICS_ALIBI_JANGILDIN_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1884, in aul Qoyadul, Turgay Oblast, General Government of the Steppes, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! The first Qazaq revolutionary Bolshevik Alibi Dzhangildin was born in 1884 in a poor family, twice ran away from home to get an education, studied in spiritual consistory in Orenburg. In 1905 he was expelled from the Moscow Academy for revolutionary activity. Then Alibi Dzhangildin advertised in newspapers that he was going to walk around the whole Earth and was looking for companions. Two young men responded to the call - Polevoy, a St. Petersburg industrial engineer, and Korovin, a teacher at the Moscow Commercial Institute. In 1910 they set out on the road, however, soon his companions stayed in Hungary, and Alibi himself crossed Serbia, Turkey, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, India, Ceylon, Indochina, Japan. He earned a living by photography. Four years later, Djangildin returned home. It is Alibi who is often called the first Qazaq traveler, our Marco Polo.\n\nIn 1915, Alibi Dzhangildin became the first Qazaq Bolshevik, a year later, together with Amangeldy Imanov, raised an armed rebellion against the tsarist government, which lasted until the February Revolution. After it, Alibi Dzhangildin went to Petrograd, where he learned a little agitation, having received a certificate from the Bolsheviks to conduct propaganda. However, in Torğai, where he came to spread Bolshevik ideas, he was arrested for two months on the orders of the Provisional Government's regional commissar Älihan Bökeihan.\n\nIn January 1918 Alibi Dzhangildin promised Ioseb Jugashvili, then People's Commissar for Nationalities, that he could undermine the efforts of the Alash Orda to establish autonomy. On May 14, 1918 Dzhangildin was appointed emergency military commissar of the Steppe region. In the summer of 1918 Dzhangildin was given 68 million rubles of aid for Turkestan and Torğai region, as well as weapons, ammunition, medicines, clothing. In August 1918, at the height of the Civil War, the detachment with the cargo boarded the schooners “Abbasin” and “Mehli” in Astrakhan, crossed the Caspian Sea, but the port was occupied by the Whites, so they had to land on a deserted shore and go through Mangyshlak. Periodically the caravan was attacked by the whites, several dozen people were killed. For 57 days the detachment passed more than three thousand kilometers, and on November 11 delivered weapons, medicines and ammunition for the Reds fighting on the Aktobe-Turkestan front. Unfortunately for him, the war the war was unfolding towards the victory of the Alash Orda and the Whites. Jangildin had to flee his homeland once again, visiting Persia and then sailing to the French Commune to meet with the Bolsheviks. He returned to Alash Orda several years ago, incognito, and started to once again organize underground communist movement, this time, as believed, he was assisted by Russia's Bukharin and People's Socialist Party."

Smagul Säduaqasov, the young leader of the organization advocated the creation of a new party with the same name, not embarrassed by the fact that he was the son-in-law of Älihan Bökeihan himself.

ALO_Land_Reform: "Modernize Land Tenure System"
ALO_Land_Reform_desc: "Although land use in the aul was formally communal and tribal, and land was nationalized, the bai semi-feudals owned the best meadow and arable lands. They leased out many arable lands and meadows. Under the guise of helping a kin, the bai gave cattle for temporary use to a poor man with the condition that the latter, receiving a part of milk and wool, took good care of the cattle, took care of increasing their fatness, and watched over the litter. For his “favor” the bai interfered in the life of the poor man and his family and forced them to work for him for free. A common form of bai exploitation was “supryaga” (“urtachestvo”). A poor man who did not have his own working cattle or seeds entered into “suppryaga” with a bai. The bai gave the poor man working cattle or seeds, and the poor man was obliged to give half or sometimes two-thirds of the harvest to the bai. The latter was not interested in the transition to cultural methods of farming, in the application of new techniques and agronomic achievements. Neither could the poor peasant crushed by need start such innovations. Therefore, the agriculture of the steppe developed extremely slowly.

The conduct of the three-level biy courts, the limitation of legal powers turned it into an administrative institution of the colonial power of the Russian Empire in the Qazaq steppe. Despite all the progressive reforms, the Biy court, always disinterested and fair, remained the main source of law and dispute resolution.

In the auls the land was already under communal management, though the semi-feudal Bais owned the arable lands, best pastures, and water.\nAfter all, while Alash leaders sought land rights, the Russian authorities blocked it. Today, reclaiming land is paramount, necessitating resolution of settler conflicts and restoration of Qazaq ownership."
ALO_legacy_of_central_asian_revolt: "Echoes of 1916 Uprising"
ALO_legacy_of_central_asian_revolt_desc: "The decades under Russian hegemony left their scars on our culture, as evidenced by the 1916 Central Asian Revolt. The price for freedom was high, with massacres, deportations, and devastated populations being just a few of the consequences. A significant portion of our population was either exterminated or deported from Central Asia, with many forced to seek refuge in the Xinjiang. Yet, the bitter memory of its failure and the ensuing consequences fuels the flames of Qazaq nationalism. We must ensure that such senseless bloodshed never haunts our land again."

### Events ###
alash.1.t: "White Sun of the Desert"
alash.1.d: "In the summer of 1917, a group of Qazaq intellectuals convened at the First All-Qazaq Congress, where they formally separated from the Cadet Party. They subsequently established the Alash Party, which espoused the principles of universal suffrage, equality, and parliamentary federalism. The Alash Party's vision for the future of the Qazaq people was one of autonomy within the Russian state. Following the October Revolution, Alash leaders condemned the Bolshevik coup and at the Second All-Qazaq Congress in December 1917 established a national Qazaq autonomy, Alash Orda, amidst anarchist unrest and the Bolshevik threat. The People's Council of Alash Orda was headed by Älihan Bökeihan, the permanent leader of the party and the nation to this day.\n\nOn June 11, 1918, the decree of Alash Orda was solemnly adopted, condemning the power of the Soviet government and asserting the sovereignty of the Qazaq people. With the assistance of allied Cossack Hosts, the Reds were subdued in Alash territory, although pockets of resistance persisted until the end of 1919. However, the aspiration for autonomy was ultimately suppressed. Despite initially cordial relations with the leaders of the White Army, the coup led by Kolchak ultimately derailed the federalization program, reducing Alash Orda to a subordinate position in the bosom of the reviving Russia.\n\nAt the Constituent Assembly in 1920, Alash Orda was restored as an autonomous territory of Russia, subordinate to it in almost all matters. However, it retained its own parliament, with a certain freedom in cultural and national affairs, as well as in economic policy, without regard to constitutional rights to private property. Many of the aspirations of the national leaders were not realized, and Alash Orda in reality remained part of the “indivisible Russia”. The Alash party established close ties with the government in Petrograd and President Kerensky. However, there was growing discontent within the state and an increasing number of voices calling for change within the party."
alash.1.a: "Interesting"

alash.899.t: "Alash Party & Halyq Keńesi"
alash.899.d: "Since 1917, the country has been ruled by Älihan Bökeihan, leader of the Alash Party, a close associate of Kerensky, the father of the Qazaq state. The country's parliament is the Halyq Keńesi, or People's Council, largely modeled on the Russian Duma. Elections are synchronized with the Russian elections, and the Minister-President of Alash Autonomy is appointed by the parliament. For many years, the People's Council has remained virtually one-party, as the Alash Party leads the parliament nearly undisputed.\n\nAmong the opposition to the ruling regime are Jas Azamat - formerly the youth branch of Alash, but now a full-fledged social-democrat party with little representation in the parliament; the Üsh-Jüz - affiliated with Left and center-left Russian SRs; and the Orenburg Cossacks - having their target quotas in the National Council based on the 1926 Orenburg Treaty."
alash.899.a: "Wake up, Qazaq!"

alash.897.t: "Assassination of President Kerensky"
alash.897.d: "Alarming news reached our capital from Petrograd, where a few hours ago President Kerensky, a friend and associate of Älihan Bökeihan, an associate and great supporter of Alash autonomy, who had done much for federal Russia, was killed.\n\nThe terrorist murderer should undoubtedly pay for his deeds, but it seems that Kerensky was the one who was able to hold the delicate balance of Russian politics in his hands, and now everything has gone into tatters. While chaos reigns in Russia, the Alash autonomy has declared mourning for the Russian president and has lowered both Russian and Alash flags."
alash.897.a: "He can be criticized, but could you be in his shoes?"

alash.895.t: "Rumors of Älihan Bökeihan's Resignation"
alash.895.d.death: "Today rumors reached the government of the Alash Orda that Älihan Bökeihan, deeply saddened by the death of his friend... President Kerensky, and also probably taking his age into account, intends to resign, for the first time allowing a new man to take the honorable place of Minister-President of the young Qazaq democracy.\n\nSo far, however, there has been no official confirmation of such information, but rumors soon leaked out to the media, and many Qazaqs read in the morning papers that the father of the nation was preparing to leave his post.\n\nIn a sense, the unprecedented excitement over such news prompted members of the media to contact the government for comment, after which a press release was announced at which Bökeihan was scheduled to speak.\n\nOn the appointed morning, a conference of the most influential acting ministers was assembled, headed by Älihan Bökeihan himself, who announced the beginning of a new era for the Alash autonomy. The Father of the Nation spoke at length about the possibilities for modernizing and improving the living conditions of ordinary Qazaqs, and finally, at the end of his speech, made an important announcement, finally putting an end to all the rumors surrounding his resignation."
alash.895.d.age: "Today rumors reached the government of the Alash Orda that Älihan Bökeihan, probably taking his age into account, intends to resign, for the first time allowing a new man to take the honorable place of Prime Minister of the young Qazaq democracy.\n\nSo far, however, there has been no official confirmation of such information, but rumors soon leaked out to the media, and many Qazaqs read in the morning papers that the father of the nation was preparing to leave his post.\n\nIn a sense, the unprecedented excitement over such news prompted members of the media to contact the government for comment, after which a press release was announced at which Bökeihan was scheduled to speak.\n\nOn the appointed morning, a conference of the most influential acting ministers was assembled, headed by Älihan Bökeihan himself, who announced the beginning of a new era for the Alash autonomy.

alash.895.a: "Bökeihan remains for the sake of the Qazaq people..."
alash.895.b: "The rumors are confirmed and Bökeihan resigns..."

alash.894.t: "Gold Mining Joint Stock Company \"Altai\""
alash.894.d: "The Gold Mining Joint Stock Company \"Altai\", originally a Russian enterprise established in 1915, has undergone significant changes since its inception. Initially managed from Petrograd, the company focused on gold mining in the [404.GetName] and [402.GetName] regions. It acquired properties from the trading house \"V. M. Fonyakov and Co.\" and expanded its operations to include mines in [404.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and Zaisan counties of [810.GetName] region, and later in [583.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_10284] uyezd of [402.GetName] region. Annually, the company produced approximately 25 poods of gold. The Chairman of the Board was L.R. Gaveman, also known for managing the Yusupov family's assets.\n\nWith the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, all assets of the Altai Gold Industry Company were nationalized, listed among the \"largest enterprises\" subjected to state control. However, after the civil war, a law was passed under which mining companies could be partially privatized provided that a controlling interest was held by the state and the state had the right to anytime nationalize the company. Altai was partially privatized in this way, and while we had exclusive rights to own the nationalized part of the company, since the resources were located precisely on our territory, the management was still from Petrograd.\n\nSignificant economic shifts followed, including the introduction of the gold-backed Chervonets Ruble in Russia and its subsequent abandonment due to the economic crisis and the collapse of the Berlin Stock Exchange. This economic instability led to a diminished interest in the Altai Gold Mining Joint Stock Company from Russian authorities. Recognizing an opportunity, the government plans to assert greater control over the company. With the waning Russian interest, this moment is ideal to restructure the board of the company, ensuring that a reliable and trustworthy individual is appointed to oversee operations and prevent the flow of gold out of [ROOT.GetName]."
alash.894.a: "This is our gold."
alash.894.b: "That's too risky."

alash.8940.t: "Nationalization of \"Altai\" Joint Stock Company"
alash.8940.d: "The gold mining joint stock company Altai, a key player in the gold mining industry, has historically been managed with significant Russian participation. Despite the nationalization of the company by the Bolsheviks, a law was passed after the Civil War under which mining companies could be partially privatized provided that a controlling interest was held by the state and the state had the right to anytime nationalize the company. Altai was partially privatized in this way, as were many other companies in the country. The situation was complicated by the fact that according to our constitution, the Alash autonomy as a subject of the federation had exclusive rights to own the nationalized part of the company, since the resources were located precisely on its territory.\n\nThe recent abandonment of the gold standard, caused by the economic crisis and the collapse of the Berlin Stock Exchange, reduced the interest of our beneficial shareholders in Altai JSC, in connection with which they agreed to a deal with the Alash authorities. However, the strategic importance of the gold reserve of Semipalatinsk and Turgai regions is still great. Realizing that an opportunity had arisen, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government established greater control over the company by restructuring the company's board of directors, thus eliminating any possibility of “a hand from Petrograd to get into their gold reserves”."
alash.8940.a: "Sneaky move, but it hardly makes a difference."


# Russia goes Snap Elections #
alash.893.t: "Extraordinary Elections Announced!"
alash.893.d: "In connection with the death of President Kerensky, general elections were announced in Russia, and our autonomy, as part of a federal republic, was also obliged to hold them. Usually the Qazaq population predominantly voted for the Alash party, and we even won a significant number of deputies in the all-Russian Duma, but in recent years, due to the growing popularity of Üsh-Jüz and Jas Azamat, which form unified lists with candidates from Russian parties, our majoritarianism was lost.\n\nIn general, the interest of the Qazaq population to the all-Russian elections has faded, and the turnout is quite low, but the Russians and Cossack migrants vote for Russian parties, and in recent years their support has changed towards right-wing nationalist parties, such as NRPR and VNS. We must keep an eye on these elections and not allow non-indigenous Russians to represent our autonomy in the Russian parliament."
alash.893.a: "Let us hope Russia won't fall into electoral nightmare"

alash.892.t: "Alash Party Primaries" # -> alash.888
alash.892.d: "In connection with Bökeihan's resignation and the scheduling of elections to the Halyq Keńesi in the near future, the Alash Party convened a congress to elect a candidate from the party who would become prime minister and form the government.\n\nIn recent years, the party has lost much in unity and cohesion, and is now in fact no longer a party but a coalition of political cliques. On the left flank, the Alash party is represented by a group of politicians who did not leave the party after the formation of Jas Azamat, united under the leadership of Jahansha Dosmukhamedov. They are quite radical in their policy, intending to reform the party from within and drastically change inequality. The progressive wing of the party is represented by Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, a close associate of Bökeihan, who was predicted to be his successor, but his radicalism and strong personal power base alienated the more moderate Alash members, who preferred the more pragmatic Yermekov. The moderate centrists are represented precisely by him, Bökeihan's \"named\" successor, who has secured the support of the Alash Party establishment, and who serves as the \"voice of Reason\" of the party. Politicians who want to preserve the status quo and are afraid of rocking the boat are united around him. Finally, opposed on the right is Sadyq Amanjolov - head of the Alash Militia, a military leader and defender of the Qazaq people, a nationalist who advocates the development of the army and finally the separation from Russia, prophesied by the Central Asian uprising of 1916.\n\nDespite all factions vying for power, only the two centrist candidates have a chance to win the party's primaries."
alash.892.a: "Jahansha Dosmukhamedov, Alash Party's leftist."
alash.892.b: "Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, radical modernizer."
alash.892.c: "Älimhan Yermekov, follower of Bökeihan's vision."
alash.892.e: "Sadyq Amanjolov, Qazaq nationalist."

# Russia goes Civil War or Revolution #

alash.890.t: "Revolution in Russia"
alash.890.d: "Revolution happens in Russia, and now it becomes obvious that we should cut our ties with the treacherous socialist government, that fought against our independence in the first civil war. However, the question arises if we should stay loyal to the Russian Volunteer Army, led by Lavr Kornilov, the government, based in Volgograd. While their government is likely to fight for united and indivisible Russia, we have previously agreed to become an autonomy."
alash.890.d2: "Revolution happens in Russia, and once again their government has attempted to build a society for the workers and peasants. While the opposition believes that we should not get involved and try to separate even more, some members of our government believes that instead we should support the Russian revolution this time."
alash.890.a: "Announce our support for Kornilov's regime!" #-> Rise of Kenes (wneh civil war starts)
alash.890.b: "It is high time to declare independence and stay out of this!" 
alash.890.c: "Support the Revolution!"
alash.890.e: "We should not support this unlawful regime!"

# Russian Elections #

alash.889.d.friendly: "This description is shown if a friendly government to us is elected in Russia. As we are a part of Russia, we have elections at the same time, though we share great autonomy. If the government elected, however, is chauvinistic or anti-autonomist, it will get us into problems."
alash.889.d.enemies: "This description is shown if not a friendly government to us is elected in Russia. As we are a part of Russia, we have elections at the same time, though we share great autonomy. If the government elected, however, is chauvinistic or anti-autonomist, it will get us into problems."
alash.889.a: "At least they are our allies"
alash.889.b: "A dangerous result."

# United Front failure #

alash.888.t: "Alash Unity Under Threat"
alash.888.d: "The once united Alash party has long since cracked, but now the split has only intensified after a candidate from a single bloc of political cliques was elected in the primaries. All factions, except for the winning one, were dissatisfied with the results, and are already openly declaring distrust of the Alash Central Committee and the new candidate. \n\nSupporters of the winning candidate assure that only Älihan Bökeihan can save the situation, who should name a successor himself and thereby unite the party, probably for the last time, but skeptics state that the party unity died once and for all, and nothing will help him, so it is easier to just admit it as a fact."
alash.888.a: "The unity of the party has died out."
alash.888.b: "Bökeihan should intervene and name a successor!"

alash.887.t: "Bökeihan Names His Successor"
alash.887.d: "Älihan Bökeihan spoke today at a meeting of the Alash Central Committee with intentions to announce his successor - which from a formal legal point of view, of course, does not change the situation in any way, and the candidate elected in the primaries will remain in his place. It is the symbolic importance of Älihan that will be important, and perhaps in this way the candidate he names will be able to gain popularity with the people and seize the initiative in the future.\n\nNevertheless, the name named will hardly come as a surprise to everyone. Earlier, Bökeihan worked closely with Dulatuly, but times have changed and for the past six years another party member, Älimhan Yermekov, has firmly established a nickname of successor. That is why, when the aged father of the nation uttered the cherished name, the delegates did not breathe a sigh of relief, but only realized that the time of struggle had just begun. Yermekov did become the named successor of Bökeihan, but whether it would somehow affect the unity of the party - rather for the worse."
alash.887.a: "There are doubts that it can heal the wounds of the party"

alash.886.t: "The Race Starts" #-> alash.885

Party unity is practically at zero, but those who disagree with the results of the vote for a candidate are outraged and do not seem to allow him to be elected.\n\nThat is why in fact all 4 candidates took part in the race for the Prime Minister's seat and deployed their campaign headquarters.\n\nJahansha Dosmukhamedov, Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, Älimhan Yermekov and Sadyq Amanjolov - for the first time 4 candidates were nominated from Alash party and for the first time it was not Älihan Bökeihan. These elections promise to be interesting, but the most frightening thing for Alash, which held power for many years, is whether such clear split in the party is a tidbit and good timing for the opposition, which is increasing its power and offers people an alternative. Alternative, which for the first time may be more promising than current system."

alash.885.d: "The Uralsk region, with its administrative center in Jympity, has long been a stronghold of the Western Department of Alash Orda and the left-wing faction of the Alash Party, led by Jahansha Dosmukhamedov and his namesake, Khalel. However, this electoral season has brought unprecedented challenges to their influence. The party's central leadership hesitates to fully support the Dosmukhamedovs, leaving their campaign vulnerable to internal and external pressures. Adding to the complexity is the presence of Vladimir Tolstov, the Ataman of the Ural Cossack Host. Tolstov, a staunch opponent of democracy and Qazaq sovereignty, has consistently undermined the young Qazaq democracy in the west of the country. His malign influence now manifests in attempts to disrupt the upcoming elections. The Cossacks, under his command, plan to block polling stations in [ALO_guryev_kazakh] and intimidate Qazaq voters to thwart the electoral process. The central leadership could decide to back Jahansha Dosmukhamedov by injecting significant funds into the region to bolster his campaign. This financial support would enable the left-wing faction to effectively counter Tolstov's disruptive tactics and secure their electoral base. The government could also decide to introduce Alash Militia troops into the [ALO_guryev_kazakh] to secure polling stations and ensure a fair election process."

Without the necessary funds and strategic backing, Jahansha's campaign struggled to counteract the disruptive efforts of Ataman Vladimir Tolstov and the Cossacks. Taking full advantage of this situation, the Cossacks intensified their efforts to block polling stations and intimidate Qazaq voters. These tactics proved effective, leading to a significant suppression of voter turnout among the local Qazaq population. As a result, the Cossacks managed to secure a dominant position in the region, significantly undermining the influence of the Alash Party.\n\nFaced with this setback, Jahansha Dosmukhamedov sought alternative alliances to maintain his political relevance. He redirected his efforts towards supporting the Jas Azamat campaign."

As a result, the Alash Party achieved a significant victory in [ALO_guryev_kazakh]. The electoral success bolstered the position of the left-wing faction within the party."

alash.881.d: "In response to the Cossacks' attempts to disrupt the elections in [ALO_guryev_kazakh], the Alash government made the decisive move to deploy Militia troops to secure the polling stations. The presence of nationalist-minded Alash Militia heightened tensions with the local Cossack forces, leading to a series of violent clashes that rapidly escalated beyond the initial scope of electoral security. Seeking external assistance, the Alash government may request intervention from the Russian government to stabilize the situation, which, however, can increase influence and control by Russia over our internal affairs. On the other hand, Sadyq Amanjolov, head of the Militia, suggests declaring martial law in [ALO_guryev_kazakh], imposing strict military control to quell the violence and restore order."

However, the influence of the Alash party is under significant threat due to the actions of Ataman Vladimir Tolstov of the Ural Cossack Host. Tolstov and his followers, opponents of democracy and Qazaq sovereignty, have been intimidating voters and attempting to disrupt the electoral process to maintain their grip on power. In response, the Alash government introduced its Militia into the region to secure polling stations. This move has resulted in clashes and the situation has spiraled out of control, prompting the Alash government to request Russian intervention to stabilize the region and ensure the integrity of the elections. We now face a critical decision: whether to support the Cossack forces or the Alash government in this conflict."

Reinforcements and supplies have been sent to bolster Ataman Tolstov and his followers. With Russian support, the Cossacks quickly gain the upper hand in the clashes with the Alash Militia. Emboldened by Russian backing, they launch a series of operations to suppress Qazaq opposition. The ongoing conflict severely disrupts the electoral process. Many Qazaq voters are too intimidated to participate, leading to a significant decrease in voter turnout and calls for the elections to be postponed or annulled."

With this threat neutralized, the elections proceeded in Uralsk with the Alash government securing a decisive victory. However, surprisingly the decision to impose martial law has been met with outrage across the country. Opposition parties and civilian groups have organized protests, condemning the government's actions as undemocratic and authoritarian. Major cities, including [590.GetName] and [404.GetName], have seen large-scale demonstrations. The Üsh-Jüz party has capitalized on the unrest, using the martial law decision to discredit the Alash government. Their leaders have been vocal in denouncing the government's actions, gaining significant support from those disillusioned by the heavy-handed tactics. While the move has cost the Alash government support in many regions, it has also bolstered Amanjolov's standing among conservative and nationalist voters.

The region's most popular politician, engineer Mukhametjan Tynyshbayuly is running as the [589.GetName]'s candidate from the Alash party, but without support from the Center, it is likely he will try to align the nationalists or even completely lose the race to the Jas Azamat. While we must remember that the region is quite unstable, being on the border with Turkestan, as well as hosting Semirechye Cossacks. If we get it out of our control, it can cost us yet another problems. It is suggested to force Tynyshbayuly to end his race and support one of the Alash centrist candidates, and in return he will be given the prestige chair of the Minister of Economy."

alash.871.d: "The youth organization Jas Azamat (Young Citizen), established at the All-Qazaq Youth Congress in Omsk in May 1918, has always had a mission to unite Qazaq youth and protect national interests. Initially calling for support of the Alash Orda against the Bolsheviks, Jas Azamat rapidly evolved into an unofficial youth wing of the Alash Party. In 1922, Smagul Säduaqasov, a dynamic and ambitious young leader, was appointed as the organization's leader at the age of 21. Two years later, Säduaqasov's marriage to Yelizaveta Bökeihan, daughter of Alash Party leader and Minister-President Älihan Bökeihan, further solidified the connection between Jas Azamat and the Alash Party.\n\nHowever, as federalization of Alash Orda progressed and factionalism grew within the party, Säduaqasov became the first prominent figure to declare \"independence\" from the Alash leadership. Jas Azamat established itself as an independent party, still supporting the Alash government but not fully endorsing it. Embracing radical progressive ideas, the party pushed for modernization in the economy — something the Alash government struggled to achieve due to various constraints. Säduaqasov's vision of developing highways, railways, land reform, and unitarization did not resonate with the Alash leadership.\n\nIn the most recent elections, Jas Azamat secured 11 seats in the Halyq Keńesi, in addition to numerous victories in zemstvas, particularly in the north where they enjoyed majority support.\n\nToday, at the congress in [590.GetName], held amid great anticipation, Smagul Säduaqasov was nominated as the party's main candidate for Minister-President. The party's campaign began in earnest, with a clear focus on their progressive platform. Säduaqasov's charisma and forward-thinking policies garnered significant attention, especially among the youth and progressive elements within the country."

alash.870.d: "In November 1917, the socialist-nationalist party Üsh-Jüz was founded by the public figure and journalist Müqan Äitpenov, with the aim of uniting all Turkic nationalities in Russia in a federation. The party, organized by some dissatisfied Qazaq intellectuals, initially struggled due to its vague ideology, small size, and weak organization. Despite these setbacks, the party's amalgamation of Social Revolutionary and Islamic traditionalist ideas gradually resonated more with Qazaq society.\n\nHowever, Üsh-Jüz's reputation was marred by its early support from the Bolsheviks, seen as an alternative to the Alash. The Alash Party capitalized on every opportunity to discredit Üsh-Jüz, leading to the execution of one of its leaders, Qölbay Tögusov, by the Russian Whites, and the arrest of Müqan Äitpenov, who spent several years in prison. After receiving an amnesty from President Kerensky, Äitpenov returned to Alash Orda to re-establish Üsh-Jüz.\n\nThis time, the Alash government was unable to suppress the resurgence of Üsh-Jüz. The party was re-established and received support from the Turkestan socialists of the ERK party and the Left SR party in Russia. Üsh-Jüz, now a formidable opponent to Alash, began to publish its party newspaper again, leveling harsh criticisms and insults against the leaders of the Autonomy. A significant figure in popularizing Üsh-Jüz was Qajymuqan Munaitpasov, a world-famous circus performer and wrestler who had supported the party since its inception. His endorsement brought significant attention and credibility to the party.\n\nIn [590.GetName], the party announced the start of its electoral campaign, promoting its social-nationalist program. The campaign began with a rally attended by numerous supporters and onlookers curious about the party's platform and as the strongest man of Alash Orda, Qajymuqan, led the demonstration with a red flag in his hand, it became clear that Üsh-Jüz has returned to make itself known."

The intense rivalry between these two parties has left [590.GetName] deeply divided, with no clear winner in sight.\n\nThe Alash Party, observing the intense competition between these two factions, finds itself at a crossroads. The party can choose to align itself with Jas Azamat or focus on its own campaign efforts to secure votes in [590.GetName]. While the majority of the party's leaders believe that they should support Jas Azamat, who is currently leading in the polls, and risk losing the city to him, a slight minority believes that it would be more beneficial to secure this city for the Alash Party."

alash.866.d: "In the north of our country is a vibrant Ukrainian community known as “Grey Ukraine” or “Grey Klyn”, which has become an integral part of the cultural and social structure of the region. Historically, this community was founded by Ukrainian settlers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in search of new opportunities and lands. Over time, Grey Ukraine developed into a significant and influential enclave. The center of the diaspora was Omsk, where in 1917 the All-Ukrainian Council of Siberia was formed. On the territory of our autonomy, the [590.GetName] Ukrainian Rada and its chairman V. Nagirnyi have a special influence.\n\nUkrainian settlers brought with them a rich cultural heritage, including their language, traditions, and agricultural practices. They established thriving farms, schools, and cultural centers, creating a network that preserved their identity. Despite successful settlement, the Ukrainian community in Alash-Orda faces a number of challenges. Economic pressures, cultural preservation, and political representation are ongoing challenges for the residents of Grey Ukraine. Recent trends in the views of Qazaq politicians are to deprive these colonizers of a presence in Qazaq lands, in a similar vein as they plan to do with their Russian counterparts."

The program and charter of the Ittifoqi Muslimin emphasize strict adherence to Sharia law, the promotion of national religious values, and the economic support of madrasas.\n\nDuring the current electoral campaign, Ittifoqi Muslimin has focused on promoting the nationalist candidate, leveraging their extensive network and effective propaganda strategies. Their efforts have yielded significant results, with the Alash Party observing a noticeable shift in voter sentiment. There is growing concern that Ittifoqi Muslimin's influence could completely absorb the nationalist opposition in these southern regions, resulting in a substantial nationalist lobby within the government."

The crisis has hit agriculture and pastoralism particularly hard, undermining the livelihoods of many Qazaqs who rely on livestock, especially horses, and especially among nomads.\n\nHistorical clan rivalries are again exacerbated by the fragmentation of the country and the party.

A member of the Qypşaq clan and a descendant of the notable Qazaq bai Niyaz Tileuiūly, Janbosynūly received a solid Islamic education and devoted much of his early life to farming, irrigation, and education, even establishing a school in his aul.\n\nWith the onset of the 1916 revolt, Janbosynūly was proclaimed Khan of the Qypşaq Qazaqs. He commanded the eastern half of the rebellion, while Ospan Şolaqūly led the western half under the Argyn clan. Despite his nominal political leadership, Janbosynūly delegated most authority to an elected council of twenty representatives, a system that came to be known as 'Steppe Democracy'. His focus remained primarily on military affairs. On 22 October 1916, Janbosynūly's forces besieged Torğai. However, the siege was abandoned in favor of direct confrontation with Russian troops. Following this, his troops strategically retreated to Batbakkara, engaging in guerrilla warfare. During this period, Şolaqūly's forces suffered a defeat at the hands of the Russians, while Janbosynūly continued to resist until the February Revolution prompted his troops to stand down.\n\nPost-revolt, Janbosynūly remained active in the political turmoil of the Russian Civil War, helping to establish Soviet power in Orenburg. However, his alliance with the Bolsheviks was short-lived, leading him to join forces with the Alash Militia. In the ensuing years, he became a supporter of the Üsh-Jüz party, though his political activities were limited.\n\nNow, in his sixties, Janbosynūly's role shifted significantly. Organizing a congress in Torğai, he formally declared his support for Üsh-Jüz and called upon all Batyrs to join the party. His commitment to the party was further solidified with an invitation to join the Üsh-Jüz Central Committee. This development is seen as a unifying moment for many nationalists, who now find a common platform in Üsh-Jüz under Janbosynūly's influential leadership."

alash.1300.t: "The Rule of the Young Citizens"
alash.1300.d: "Following the victory of the Jas Azamat party in the national elections, the first ever victory of another party, rather than Alash, a grand rally was held in [810.GetName], marking the beginning of a new era for the [ROOT.GetName]. The newly elected Minister-President, Smagul Säduaqasov, addressed the crowd, outlining the party’s main aims for the years to come. First off, the critical need to address the problem of federalization within the country. He highlighted the existing divisions — between East and West, Turkestan and the Steppe — and underscored the importance of national unity. Säduaqasov declared that preventing tribal discord and regional feuds was paramount. He called for all Qazaqs to come together as a united nation and country, stressing that the strength of the nation lies in its unity.\n\nThe second major aim outlined was the need to deal with the entrenched establishment. For decades, the Alash party had monopolized governance, becoming synonymous with Qazaq identity. While Jas Azamat had once been inseparable from Alash, new times called for the necessity to break the centralization of all structures, authorities, armed forces, and cultural institutions around the Alash party.\n\nThe rally ended, and the new page is opened for the Qazaq state."
alash.1300.a: "We hope our rule will bring Qazaqs much-needed prosperity and enlightenment."

alash.1299.t: "Your Bets, Gentlemen"
alash.1299.d: "The split within the Alash party has become more than obvious. Different factions are fighting for power, privileges, and the loyalty of their supporters among the elites, not only within the party but also in state bodies. For our leadership it becomes obvious that there may not be a definitive winner in this internal struggle.\n\nFour main factions vie for dominance within Alash: the left-wing of Jahansha Dosmuhamedov, the radical wing of Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, and the moderate wing of Älimhan Yermekov, and the national conservatives of Sadyq Amanjolov.\n\nThe Alash Left, led by Dosmuhamedov, lean towards more progressive policies and social reforms, which could align well with some of our goals. However, they are known federalists, who controlled the Oyil Vilayat for decades and want to preserve their autonomy. The Alash Radicals, under Dulatuly, are known for their strong nationalist stance and uncompromising attitude towards foreign influence. They are, however, even more radical in their modernization program, than us, largely due to the influence of the reforms of Mustafa Kemal, Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, on the views of Dulatuly. The Alash Moderates, headed by Yermekov, advocate for stability and gradual reforms. They also are seeking to retain good relations with Russia."
alash.1299.d2: "$alash.1299.d$\n\nThe most interesting is that our leadership views all factions equally as the establishment - the people who added to centralisation of power in the hands of their own party. Perhaps, instead of attempting to mend a fractured party, we can let the Alash factions bleed while positionin ourselves as the stable and unifying force the country needed."
alash.1299.a: "We need weaker alleis - Dosmuhamedov and his supporters."
alash.1299.b: "We need strong allies - Dulatuly and his radicals."
alash.1299.c: "We need moderate allies - Yermekov and his moderates."
alash.1299.e: "We don't need allies - time of Alash is up!"

alash.1298.t: "Land Reform Initiative"
alash.1298.d: "Historically, Qazaqs had suffered significant land expropriations during the Russian Empire's expansion. Settlers, supported by Cossack troops, seized fertile lands traditionally used by Qazaq nomads for grazing. This had left many Qazaq families landless or with insufficient land to sustain their livelihoods. The aftermath of the Russian Revolution and the ensuing civil strife further complicated land ownership. Many settlers and Cossacks still held large tracts of land, while returning Qazaqs found themselves struggling to reclaim their ancestral territories. One of the unrealized ambition of the Alash national movement was to seize the lands, colonized by the Russians and return them back to the Qazaqs.\n\nThe Jas Azamat government has now established a Land Reform Commission to tackle these disparities. The commission's mandate included a thorough inventory of all land plots across Alash Orda, evaluating the current status of land owned by settlers, Cossacks, and Biys. The main question is however what to do with the land afterwards - should we establish a quota system to ensure equitable land distribution, or outright seize all settler lands."

In this document, Säduaqasov emphasized the crucial role of youth in shaping the future and developing a collective national consciousness. Drawing on the experience of the Birlik (Unity) organization during his studies at the Omsk Agricultural School, he sought to harness the energy and potential of the younger generation to bring about social and cultural transformation. Säduaqasov believes that the key to prosperity and unity [ROOT.GetName] lies in the active participation of youth.\n\nOne of the central aspects of Säduaqasov's youth policy will be the promotion of modern education. He urged young Kazakhs to pursue higher education and acquire the modern knowledge and skills that are necessary for the progress of the nation. Säduaqasov's public speeches on the subject were characterized by fierce criticism of the ignorance and unscrupulousness of the older generation, which made him a revered figure among the youth. His unwavering stance and articulate arguments provided clear guidance to young leaders, inspiring them to make systematic and organized efforts in their communities.\n\nTo awaken the civic consciousness of the masses, Säduaqasov emphasizes the need for young people to learn non-traditional professions and engage in various activities. This approach allows them to move away from familiar roles and stimulates innovation and creativity among the youth, which ultimately contributes to the economic and cultural development of [ROOT.GetName]."

alash.1295.t: "Rise of the Patriotic Youth"
alash.1295.d: "Inspired by Säduaqasov's vision and leadership, young Qazaqs began to unite in a patriotic youth organization known as Jas Búrkitter (Young Eagles). The founding meeting of Jas Búrkitter was held in the bustling town of [1203.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Young Qazaqs from different regions dressed in traditional attire gathered in a large yurt erected in the center of the city for this special occasion. It was decided that the group would have local chapters in every major city and region, each headed by elected representatives. The organization's activities would focus on three main areas: education, cultural preservation, and civic engagement.\n\nIn the following months, local chapters of Jas Búrkitter sprang up all over the country. In both villages and urban centers, young Qazaqs began to meet regularly, organizing study groups, cultural events and community service projects. Civic engagement became perhaps the most transformative aspect of Jas Búrkitter's mission. Members of the organization took on projects to improve their communities and participated in local government, ensuring that young people's voices were heard in the decision-making process.\n\nOne significant project was the construction of a new school in the village of Torğai. Funded and built entirely by members of Jas Búrkitter, the school has become a symbol of what young Qazaqs can achieve through collective effort and determination. The opening ceremony was grand, attended by Säduaqasov and other prominent figures as well as the local community."
alash.1295.a: "A worthy example for all young people!"

alash.1294.t: "Renaissance of Qazaq Theater"
alash.1294.d: "The Qazaq theater is now experiencing a significant renaissance, marked by the production of plays written by Qazaq playwrights. This period saw the continued development of a theatrical tradition that had been burgeoning since the early 20th century, exemplified by Muhtar Äuezov's landmark play \"Eńlik — Kebek\", which was first staged in Abay aul with Äuezov himself directing and prompting.\n\nSäduaqasov's support for such works ensured that theater, as a new social institution, not only entertained but also educated and inspired a sense of national identity among the people. The theatrical tradition, while seemingly new, drew upon the rich heritage of Qazaq oral culture, particularly the Aitys — a unique folk-oriented, oral tradition of improvised singing and oratory between two participants - aqyns.\n\nA notable milestone in this cultural renaissance is the staging of the opera \"Qyz-Jibek\" and the play \"Batyr Bayan\". \"Qyz-Jibek\", an opera based on a libretto by Gabit Musrepov, was staged at the Qazaq Musical Theater in [ALO_verniy_kazakh] by Jumat Shanin, a prominent director and playwright. The opera tells the tragic love story of Jibek and Tolegen, set against the patriarchal and feudal backdrop of their time. It incorporates Qazaq vocal and instrumental works, songs, and kuis by folk composers, blending traditional music with dramatic narrative.\n\nSimilarly, Mağjan Jumabaev's poem \"Batyr Bayan\" was brought to the stage, depicting the era of Khan Abylai and the valor of Qazaq batyrs, with a special focus on Kenesary Khan. These works, supported by Jas Azamat officially, reinforced a sense of national pride."
alash.1294.a: "A theater with respect to traditions."

alash.1293.t: "Celebration of Nauryz Meiramy"
alash.1293.d: "Under the guidance of the Jas Azamat party, this year's Nauryz Meiramy became a significant cultural event. For the steppe dwellers, whether nomads or farmers, the vernal equinox has always been a special day, marking the end of winter and the beginning of a new cycle of life and growth. As the first rays of the bright sun pierced through the remnants of winter, Qazaqs across the steppe felt a renewed sense of energy and optimism. They would ride out into the vast plains, inhaling the moist, dense air scented with earth and fresh shoots, knowing that the earth was ready to bloom again and provide.\n\nThis sense of renewal and readiness for creative work was at the heart of the Nauryz celebration. For Qazaqs, Nauryz, meaning "new day" in Persian, has been a time-honored tradition, celebrated since ancient times, much like the Orthodox Maslenitsa.\n\nIn the western regions of Kazakhstan, such as [587.GetName] and [406.GetName], the holiday begins earlier on March 14, known locally as \"Amal\". This period is sacred for Qazaq nomads and is accompanied by the custom of people shaking hands to express respect and uphold the spiritual and moral values of the steppe. Younger individuals visit the homes of elders, greeting them and seeking their blessings for the new year. According to an ancient Qazaq legend, on the eve of Nauryz, Kydyr ata, a wise figure from Qazaq mythology, visits forty homes, fulfilling wishes and bringing good fortune and happiness. It is believed that if the household's thoughts are pure, Kydyr ata leaves a sign on a bowl filled with sugar and flour, signifying his blessing.\n\nThis year, Nauryz Meiramy, organized by Jas Azamat, featured traditional music, dance, food, and rituals."

This festival, meticulously organized by Smagul Säduaqasov in collaboration with the renowned Russian musician-ethnographist Aleksandr Zataevich, served as a celebration of traditional Qazaq music.\n\nSince settling in Orenburg in 1920, Zataevich dedicated himself to the collection, recording, and systematization of Qazaq folk music. His efforts culminated in the recording of over 2,300 pieces of musical folklore. His seminal works, \"1000 Songs of the Qazaq People\" and \"500 Qazaq Kuys and Songs\", published in 1931, provided an extensive anthology of Qazaq musical folklore spanning from ancient times to the 1930s. Last month, the third and final volume of this musical encyclopedia, featuring recordings from the southeastern and southern regions of [ROOT.GetName], was published, marking the completion of his exhaustive documentation of Qazaq music.\n\nThe \"Qazaq Ayenderi\" festival highlighted this rich heritage by providing a stage for composers and performers to showcase their talents."

The left wing of Alash and the radicals of Dulatuly, along with Amanzholov's nationalists, actively advocate a more aggressive approach. They propose to disband the Cossack troops and put them under strict government control. On the other hand, Minister-President and moderate Alash advocate a more diplomatic solution. They believe that confrontation with the Cossacks could lead to unnecessary conflict and destabilization in the region. Instead, they propose to negotiate with the Cossack leaders on granting them a truly autonomous status within the state."

Internal divisions and factionalism within the party had played a significant role in their electoral defeat. The once cohesive party had splintered into several factions, each with its own agenda and vision for the future. Key figures within the party, including Jahansha Dosmuhamedov of the left wing, Mirjaqyp Dulatuly of the radicals, and Älimhan Yermekov of the moderates, emphasized that the party's primary focus should be on the greater good of Alash Orda, rather than individual ambitions or ideological purity.\n\nWhile they have only began their journey to the reconciliation, significant milestone - recognizing the problem - has been already completed."

This reform stripped the Biy courts of their administrative functions, relegating them to a more ceremonial role under colonial rule. Despite these changes, Biy courts continued to operate in many communities, providing a familiar and respected means of resolving conflicts.\n\nThe Jas Azamat administration has declared its intent to modernize the nation's judicial system and announced the complete abolition of Biy courts, replacing them with a contemporary system of civil courts designed to align with modern legal standards and practices.\n\nSome factions within the government and the legal community advocate for codifying the Jeti Jarği, an ancient set of Qazaq laws. They propose developing new civil and penal codes based on these teachings, thereby preserving the essence of Qazaq legal system. The others, however, argue for the adoption of the Russian civil and penal codes, which have already been translated into the Qazaq language by Jahansha Dosmukhamedov and officially adopted in the country, albeit not widely implemented."

The new plan proposes the abolition of all existing regional divisions, effectively nullifying the traditional Vilayats. In their place, local Zemstvas will handle self-governance in their respective auls, villages, and towns. These Zemstvas, composed of elected representatives from the local populace, will take on responsibilities for various local administrative functions, from infrastructure maintenance to public services. This reform is seen as a crucial step in reducing the influence of regional power brokers and eliminating the remnants of the old feudal and colonial administrative structures.

A significant faction of parliamentarians is adamant that all illegally seized lands should be promptly returned to the Qazaqs, arguing that such restitution is essential for restoring rightful ownership. Conversely, the government proposes an equitable redistribution of the land, ensuring that not only the Qazaqs but also the settlers and Cossacks have fair access to land and water resources.\n\nShould the government choose to return the land to the Qazaqs, it will move swiftly to reclaim and return lands, potentially sparking significant unrest among settlers and Cossacks.

Consequently, Säduaqasov regarded class struggle, a fundamental tenet of Marxism, as an impediment to societal advancement rather than a catalyst for progress. This led him to support those forces that denied class struggle, particularly in the Qazaq steppe.\n\nSäduaqasov dedicated numerous articles in his newspaper \"Jas Azamat\" to the ideas of Robert Owen. The younger generation of Qazaqs, reading these articles, was inspired by Owen's utopian socialism and by Säduaqasov's vision of a Qazaqs country where social and economic reforms could be achieved peacefully and democratically. In its political platform, Jas Azamat consistently emphasized the importance of education and fair distribution of resources. This philosophy also influenced Säduaqasov's economic policies. He endorsed the growth of cooperatives and collective enterprises, which he perceived as a means of empowering workers and reducing economic inequality without resorting to expropriation or violence.\n\nCurrently, numerous concepts that had previously appeared to be utopian in this divided and desolate steppe are now becoming a reality.

By July 1906, the district committee of the All-Russian Railway Union was established at [1212.GetName] station of the Orenburg-Tashkent railroad, and in 1932, workers and engineers organized their own district trade union organization with the commissioning of the Turkestan-Siberian railroad.\n\nDespite these early efforts, the proletariat in [ROOT.GetName] remained underdeveloped and relatively small in number. The Alash government, preoccupied with other pressing issues, did not prioritize the working class or the burgeoning trade union movement. However, this changed under the leadership of Jas Azamat.\n\nToday, the All-Qazaq Congress of Trade Unions was convened, a significant event aimed at unifying the various trade unions under a single structure. The Congress brought together representatives from different sectors, including mining, railroads, and manufacturing, to discuss the future of the labor movement in [ROOT.GetName].\n\nOne of the most important outcomes of the Congress was the establishment of a state association of Qazaq trade unions, symbolically named 'Birlik' (Unity). This name paid homage to the association of Qazaq youth, Birlik, which was the predecessor to the Jas Azamat party."
alash.1273.d: "Qazaq working class is growing."

alash.1272.t: "[GetAzatName] Stops Cooperating"
alash.1272.d: "Due to our recent political choices, the [GetAzatName] has grown significantly worried about an alliance with us. As their disagreement grew, they became less and less satisfied. Now, they believed was the last drop. We were approached by [GetAzatName] leaders, who told us that they leave any negotiations or coalitions with us."

alash.800.t: "Ministry of Modernization"
alash.800.d: "Under the visionary leadership of Minister-President Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, Alash Orda embarks on a bold path towards modernization and progress. Recognizing the need for comprehensive reforms to propel the nation into the 20th century, the government establishes the Ministry of Modernisation to spearhead this transformative agenda. At the helm of this pivotal ministry stands Muqysh Boshtaev, a trusted confidant and close ally of Minister-President. Boshtaev brings a wealth of experience and expertise to his new role, having served as a judge in the Aqmola region and later as the head of the Alash Agricultural Bank. Under Boshtaev's leadership, the ministry will work tirelessly to implement progressive reforms across various sectors, laying the foundation for a prosperous and forward-thinking nation."
alash.800.d2: "Mirjaqyp Dulatuly's influence remains paramount within the corridors of power. Recognizing the imperative of modernization, Dulatuly has persuaded Halyq Keńesi and [ROOT.GetLeader] to establish the Ministry of Modernisation, a bold step towards realizing Alash Orda's potential. Embracing his role as the head of this crucial ministry, Dulatuly plans to bring his visionary leadership and unwavering commitment to the task at hand. With his track record of advocacy for progressive reforms and dedication to the welfare of the Qazaq people, Dulatuly is uniquely positioned to spearhead the modernization agenda. While some of our party members are concerned, whether this is not just a waste of money and another attempt of Dulatuly to present himself as Bökeihan’s \"true successor\"."
alash.800.a: "We hope Dulatuly will lead us into the future."

### Wounds of Alash ###

alash.799.t: "Redeeming Promises"
alash.799.d: "During the election campaign, Jahansha Dosmukhamedov was offered significant concessions for his promise to support the Alash Center campaign in the West region. He has accomplished his promice, securing a decisive victory for the Alash in [ALO_guryev_kazakh]. It is our time to carry out our pledge. In return, Jahansha is to be re-appointed the governor of the Oyil Vilayat, as well as his namesake Khalel receiving the chair of the Foreign Ministry.\n\nWhile the appointment of the quite leftist Dosmukhamedovs to the new offices will help us secure the Western wing of the party, it will greatly dissatisfy the nationalists on the right."
alash.799.a: "We pay our bills."

alash.798.t: "Redeeming Promises"
alash.798.d: "During the election campaign, Mukhametjan Tynyshbayuly was offered a place in the government if during his campaign in [589.GetName] he will support the Alash Center. Eventually, he significantly increased chances for our victory in this strategically important region and we will forever be grateful. Despite Tynyshbayuly is generally said to be a centrist, he is close to the Alash nationalists. Perhaps, now we have greater chance to find a common ground with Amanjolov, even though the leftist faction, especially the Western wing, will dissaprove of this."
alash.798.d2: "During the election campaign, Mukhametjan Tynyshbayuly was offered a place in the government if during his campaign in [589.GetName] he will support the Alash Nationalists. Eventually, he significantly increased chances for our victory in this strategically important region and we will forever be grateful. Despite Tynyshbayuly is generally said to be a centrist, he is a reliable partner. Perhaps, now we have greater chance to find a common ground with Yermekov."
alash.798.a: "Having such a man in the government is great."

alash.797.t: "Ministry of Modernisation Sets Ambitious Deadlines"
alash.797.d: "The Ministry of Modernization has taken a bold initiative to address the key challenges facing Alash Orda. Recognizing the urgent need for change, in an unprecedented move, the Ministry of Modernization is announcing a series of deadlines to address some of the most pressing issues.\n\n2 Year Deadline: Addressing illiteracy.\nRecognizing that access to education is fundamental to the country's progress, the Ministry of Modernization is committed to eliminating illiteracy in all regions of Alash Orda within one year. As part of this initiative, schools will be established, teachers trained and educational resources distributed to ensure that every citizen, regardless of background or circumstances, has the opportunity to acquire the necessary literacy skills.\n\n3 Year Deadline: Addressing the problem of Russian settlers.\nAddressing the complex problem of Russian settlers in the territories of [ALO.GetName], the Ministry of Modernization sets a two-year deadline to resolve tensions and create a fair land law.\n\n4 Year Deadline: Transition to a sedentary lifestyle\nWith a bold vision for the future, the Ministry of Modernization sets a three-year deadline to facilitate the transition of nomadic Qazaq tribes to a sedentary lifestyle. Through targeted infrastructure investments, vocational training programs, and economic incentives, the Ministry aims to enable nomadic populations to settle in permanent settlements and engage in sustainable agriculture."
alash.797.a: "We must do whatever it takes to achieve these goals."
alash.797.b: "So, they are planning to do this on their own?"

alash.796.t: "Question of the Biy Courts"
alash.796.d: "The centuries-old institution of Biy courts, deeply rooted in Qazaq traditions and culture, has come under scrutiny in connection with the planned judicial reforms. As a result of the Russian judicial reform of 1864, the Biy courts largely lost their traditional importance as a legal institution, ceding administrative functions to colonial rule. Despite these changes, the Biy courts are still the basis for legal regulation and dispute resolution in Qazaq society.\n\nNow that Alash Orda needs to modernize and strengthen the legal system, it has to decide what to do with the Biy courts. One idea is to regulate their activities by the state, which would keep their traditional role but also subject them to supervision and control. Proponents say this respects Qazaqs cultural heritage and maintains continuity in the legal system. However, some people think that the government regulating the Biy courts could make them less independent and impartial, which would make them less effective at providing fair justice. Also, it would be hard to regulate these courts because they are decentralized and informal, which would create lots of logistical and administrative problems.\n\nAnother option is that Alash Orda might decide to completely get rid of the Biy courts and replace them with a modern system of civil courts. People who support this idea say that civil courts are more transparent and follow legal standards better. However, some people think that getting rid of the Biy courts completely could make some people feel left out. Also, setting up civil courts would take a lot of money and resources, which might be hard to find in a society that is still moving from a nomadic to a sedentary lifestyle."
alash.796.a: "Biy courts must remain."
alash.796.b: "Get rid of this survival of times past."

alash.795.t: "Regulation of Biy Courts"
alash.795.d: "While it was decided to keep the Biy courts, the government of Alash Orda has to come up with a way to regulate these traditional legal institutions. One idea is to create committees made up of legal experts, members of the public, and government officials. These committees will oversee the Biy courts and make sure that everything is done according to the law. They will also audit the Biy courts and judicial proceedings.\n\nAnother option is to codify the laws of Jeti Jarği, which will serve as a comprehensive legal basis for the trial of Biys. By formalizing the principles and procedures set out in the "Jeti Jarği", the government can standardize the judicial process and clarify the rights and obligations in legal disputes. Also, making the laws of Jeti Jarği official would make the decisions of the Biy courts more consistent and predictable, which would boost public confidence in the judicial system.\n\nAs a big step towards modernization, there's another option that would bring the Biy courts into the national judicial system of Alash Orda. By putting the Biy courts under the jurisdiction of higher courts and legal institutions, the government is trying to make sure that everything is done the same way and that everyone follows the national laws and regulations."
alash.795.a: "Establish judicial oversight committees"
alash.795.b: "Codify the Jeti Jarği"
alash.795.c: "Integrate the biy courts into national judiciary."

alash.794.t: "Codification of Jeti Jarği Laws"
alash.794.d: "The Alash Orda government started putting together a set of laws based on the teachings of Jeti Jarği. In addition to these, there is also the codification of the “Code of Qasim Khan” and Esim Khan's ordinance, as well as the provisions of the congresses of biys - “Yerezhe”, and “Biler sezi” - stories containing information on the practice of the biys' court - judicial precedents. Together, the laws cover a wide range of topics, from land disputes to family matters.\n\nAccording to the proposed plan, a team of lawyers and scholars will be assembled to carefully study and document the laws of Jeti Jarği, highlighting key principles and procedures that will form the basis of a unified legal code. Rayymjan Marsekuly, one of the first professional lawyers of the Alash Orda and Chairman of the Alash-Qala Zemstvo, will lead the team. They'll use historical texts, oral traditions, and scientific research to capture the essence of Jeti Jarği and adapt it to modern society."
alash.794.a: "Great!"

alash.793.t: "Civil Code for Alash Orda"
alash.793.d: "The government has announced plans to adopt a comprehensive civil code that will replace the traditional Biy and Sharia courts. The Ministry of Modernization is pushing for a switch to Western models of jurisprudence and is considering adopting the Swiss Civil Code as the basis for its new legal framework. Alternatively, Alash Orda could turn to its historical ties with Russia and adopt the Russian Civil Code as the basis for its new legal code. For those who want to keep the cultural heritage and legal traditions of Qazaqs, the codification of the laws of \"Jeti Jarği\" is a great alternative to Western or Russian legal models. By formalizing and modernizing traditional Qazaq laws, Alash Orda can create a unique legal code that reflects the values and norms of its society."
alash.793.a: "The Swiss civil code should be the base."
alash.793.b: "The Russian civil code will be more convenient for us."
alash.793.c: "Codify the Jeti Jarği"

alash.792.t: "Independent Muftiate for Alash Orda"
alash.792.d: "The idea of an independent Muftiate first emerged during the Second All-Qazaq Congress, where efforts to establish a separate religious institution for Qazaqs were thwarted by the influence of the Russian-controlled Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly. However, with the dawn of a new era of Alash sovereignty, the time has come to assert Qazaq control over religious matters and break free from external influence.\n\nUnder the proposed plan, the independent Muftiate for Alash Orda would serve as the supreme religious authority for the Qazaq people, responsible for overseeing religious practices, issuing religious rulings (fatwas), and administering religious institutions across the territory. The Mufti was also elected - Qabysh Berdalin, a famous Aqyn from Pavlodar region. He also headed the Pavlodar district branch of the Alash party. Led by a respected and knowledgeable Mufti, the Muftiate would uphold the principles of Islam.\n\nWhile the majority of ministers supported the establishment of the Muftiate, the leftist members, while endorsing this step towards independence, also criticized the decision for blurring the boundaries between church and state, calling for complete secularisation of the state."
alash.792.a: "Another colonial pillar is destroyed."

alash.791.t: "Office of Religious Affairs"
alash.791.d: "The Government has decided to establish the Office of Religious Affairs, a step against the growing concern about the influence of Qadimism and the need to promote secular values and tolerance in society. Although officially Alash Orda was formed as an autonomy within the Russian Republic and was secular according to Article 35 of the Constitution of the RDFR, the reality on the ground paints a more complex picture. Despite the constitutional provisions on secular governance, Islam continues to play a significant role in shaping social norms and traditions, and Sharia courts still operate in some regions. Moreover, the emergence of fundamentalist ideologies fueled by external influence from Turkestan poses a threat to the stability and progress of the Alash society.\n\nAccording to the proposed plan, the Office of Religious Affairs will serve as the central body responsible for overseeing all matters related to faith, worship and ethics in Alash Orda. The Office will actively promote secularism and tolerance in the Alash society, advocating the separation of religion from the state, while respecting the rights of individuals to freely profess their faith."
alash.791.a: "Another step towards modernization."

alash.790.t: "Reform of the Madrasas"
alash.790.d: "Jadidism, a reformist movement within the Islamic world, advocates for the modernization of education and the integration of Western scientific and technological advancements into traditional Islamic teachings. Originating in the late 19th century, Jadidism emerged as a response to the challenges posed by colonialism and the need to adapt Islamic education to the demands of the modern era. Under the government's plan, Jadid schools will receive increased support and resources to expand their reach and enhance the quality of education offered to students. Furthermore, the law will provide framework to spread New-Method teaching to all Madrasas of the country, potentially allowing to close any Qadimist madrasas.\n\nThe law is criticized by both the left and right - the left complain about lack of government funding for secular schools and public education for non-Muslims, while the right denigrate the government as apostates from the traditional Islamic faith."
alash.790.a: "Jadidism is the future of Islam."

alash.789.t: "Universal Public Education"
alash.789.d: "In a significant policy change aimed at modernizing the education system and promoting secular values, the Government of Alash Orda announced the creation of a comprehensive programme of universal public education and the establishment of a Ministry of National Education. Accessible and high-quality education for all citizens, regardless of their socio-economic status or cultural beliefs, is to be provided, while respecting secular norms and a Western approach to learning.\n\nUnder the new program, the Government will prioritize the development of a robust public education infrastructure that meets the diverse needs of the population and fosters a culture of intellectual growth, critical thinking, and social mobility. The Government will invest in expanding and improving public schools across the country, with a particular focus on increasing access to education in underserved areas and improving the quality of facilities, teaching staff and educational resources. A standardized curriculum based on secular principles and Western educational standards will be developed for implementation in all public schools. Comprehensive training programs will be organized for teachers to equip them with the pedagogical knowledge, teaching methods and subject matter expertise necessary to provide quality instruction in accordance with the new curriculum.\n\nWith regard to religious education, New-Method madrasas, both public and private, could be funded by religious entities through the Ministry of Education, while support for Qadimist and traditional madrasas would be suspended. Jadidism will be supported at the ministerial level, while maintaining the secularism of the state and actively sponsoring secularism.\n\nOf course, the measures have met resistance, largely from traditionalists and the right-wing in parliament, but these measures are necessary for the sake of modernization and development of the country."
alash.789.a: "We'll deal with illiteracy once and for all!"

alash.788.t: "Yermekov Challenges Dulatuly"
alash.788.t2: "Dulatuly Challenges Yermekov"
alash.788.d: "There is a sense of competition within the Alash party, with different factions vying to be recognized as the true successors to Älihan Bökeihan, the respected founder and guiding star of the movement.\nThe radical wing, led by Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, is advocating for a more progressive approach, including secular rule, westernized education, and economic liberalization. Dulatuly and his supporters believe that the best way to honor Bökeihan's legacy is to address the challenges facing Qazaq society, including the need to modernize and diversify the economy. They also believe that it is important to resist Russia's influence on the country. Dulatuly's charismatic leadership and passionate advocacy of progressive ideals have attracted a significant number of supporters to the party, especially among urban intellectuals and young professionals.\n\nBy contrast, the moderate wing, led by Älimhan Yermekov, places a strong emphasis on continuity, stability, and gradual progress. Yermekov is often seen as a voice of reason and moderation, and he has been known to prioritize gradual reforms, institutional sustainability, and consensus-building in policymaking. With his experience in the party establishment and his reputation as a diplomat, Yermekov enjoys the support of various segments of the population, urban and rural communities, and those who are interested in maintaining the status quo and moving forward with caution on the path of modernization.\n\nAs the struggle for power continues, both wings of the Alash party are trying to strengthen their positions and secure leadership."
alash.788.a: "Interesing."

alash.787.t: "Yermekov Ousted From Office"
alash.787.d: "After a protracted struggle for power in the Alash party, the Radical wing wins, strengthening its influence and actually displacing the moderate wing. Minister-President Yermekov was forced to resign from his post after supporters of Dulatuly threatened to raise the issue of confidence in the government in the Halyq Keńesi. On the extraordinary congress the next week, Mirjaqyp Dulatuly was appointed as the acting Minister-President, until new elections to the parliament.\n\nNot only the government, but the party leadership positions were also restructed, with the remnants of 'Yermekov's political clique' forced to leave the party or publicly condemn Yermekov."
alash.787.a: "Alash grow more united, don't they?"

alash.786.t: "Dulatuly Ousted From Office"
alash.786.d: "After a protracted struggle for power in the Alash party, the Moderate wing wins, strengthening its influence and actually displacing the radicals. Minister-President Dulatuly was forced to resign from his post after supporters of Yermekov threatened to raise the issue of confidence in the government in the Halyq Keńesi. On the extraordinary congress the next week, Älimhan Yermekov was appointed as the acting Minister-President, until new elections to the parliament.\n\nNot only the government, but the party leadership positions were also restructed, with the remnants of 'Dulatuly's political clique' forced to leave the party or publicly condemn Yermekov."

alash.785.t: "Moderate Wing Dissolves"
alash.785.d: "After a protracted struggle for power in the Alash party, it is now became clear that the Moderate wing has lost this war. Today, Älimhan Yermekov, the leader of the Moderate wing, has announced that he is retiring from politics in order to devote his time and energy to be a professor of Mathematics at the [ALO_verniy_kazakh] Mining and Metallurgical Institute.\n\nWith him gone, his 'political clique' has also dissolved with the majority of its members supporting Mirjaqyp Dulatuly."

alash.784.t: "Radical Wing Dissolves"
alash.784.d: "After a protracted struggle for power in the Alash party, it is now became clear that the Liberate wing has lost this war. Today, Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, the leader of the Moderate wing, has announced that he is retiring from politics in order to return to publishing and teaching activities.\n\nWith him gone, his 'political clique' has also dissolved with the majority of its members either supporting Älimhan Yermekov or Jahansha Dosmukhamedov."

alash.783.t: "Reform of the Alphabet"
alash.783.d: "The Qazaq alphabet is based on Arabic script, called 'Jana emle', - created by Baytursynuly in 1912 and officially adopted in 1924. This alphabet was an adaptation of the Arabic script to the phonological features of the Qazaq language. At the initiative of the Ministry of Modernization, a bold proposal was put forward to switch to the Latin alphabet. Proponents of this reform emphasize the benefits of interconnectedness and cultural conformity to the broader Turkic language sphere, envisaging closer ties with the Ottomans and other Turkic-speaking peoples. However, there are dissenters in the government who strongly oppose this proposal. Supporters of the preservation of "Jana emle" insist on the need to preserve the linguistic heritage and phonetic accuracy.\n\nConversely, Cyrillic supporters, driven by Russophile sentiments, advocate the restoration of historical ties with Russia. They consider the Cyrillic alphabet not just as an alphabet, but also as a means of transmitting the cultural and political heritage of the Russian Empire."
alash.783.a: "Jana emle shall stay for years to come."
alash.783.b: "Adopt the Latin - we must modernize, not be colonized."
alash.783.c: "Adopt the Cyrillic - for better mutual understanding with the Russians."

alash.782.t: "Land Tenure Reform"
alash.782.d: "Since its inception, the Alash government has grappled with the land ownership in the region. Qazaq leaders have long advocated for the restitution of lands seized from them during the Russian colonial period, particularly in northern arable lands, where Russian settlers have become the majority. A critical decision on land reform looms large.\nThe Ministry of Modernization, supported by the [GetAzatName], [GetZhasAzamatName] and even such political outsiders, as Üsh-Jüz and [GetNationalistName] on this matter, wants to proceed with the immediate redistribution of land, prioritizing the return of confiscated territories to Qazaq communities. This move is likely to strengthen the government's legitimacy among disenfranchised Qazaq populations and fulfill a long-standing promise of the Alash party. However, while this decision may appease Qazaq nationalists and bolster internal stability, it would most likely provoke a backlash from Russian settlers, Cossacks, and the Russian state, serving as a great threat to our diplomatic relations and internal stability. Furthermore, rapid land redistribution may disrupt agricultural production and investment, leading to a short-term economic instability.\n\nOn the other hand, a quite unpopular decision lies - maintaing the existing land tenure system, allowing Russian settlers to retain ownership of their lands in Alash Orda. Making this choice will avoid potential conflicts and ethnic tensions, but will unconditionally lead to a political crisis."
alash.782.a: "Enact immediate land redistribution."
alash.782.b: "Maintain Status Quo."

alash.781.t: "Quiet Before the Storm"
alash.781.d: "Following the government's decision to proceed with immediate land redistribution in Alash Orda, Russian settlers grapple with the implications of losing their land and livelihoods. The response varies widely among the settler communities: in some regions the process of land redistribution unfolds relatively peacefully. Settlers who occupy small plots of land and lack significant resources willingly surrender their holdings to indigenous Qazaq families, and either seek refuge in [RUS.GetName] or move to the cities to earn their fortune. However, there was also blood. As local conflicts erupted between Qazaqs and Settlers, both sides suffered casualties. In Semirechye, the situation deteriorated even further. The region, already known for its volatile mix of ethnic tensions, saw large-scale revolts among the settler population. Armed clashes broke out, leading to significant destruction. Settler militias, bolstered by support from sympathetic Cossack groups, fortified their positions and prepared for prolonged resistance against the government's decrees.\n\nAdditionally, in urban centers, the Russian majority mobilizes in protests to contest the government's land redistribution policies. Settlers seek injunctions and court rulings to halt the implementation of land reforms, arguing that they violate property rights and undermine the rule of law."
alash.781.a: "The situation becomes serious."

alash.780.t: "Selective Enforcement"
alash.780.d: "According to previous negotiations with the Cossack Hosts, their lands were recognized as the property of the Cossacks, therefore the government should not involve into economic matters of the Hosts. However, as local Qazaq populations pledge to return their lands, some of our nationalist-minded ministers suggest that we should deprive the Cossacks of their arable lands as well, resettling it with the Qazaq owner.\n\nThis would, no doubt, signify a 'declaration of war' by the Cossack Atamans."
alash.780.a: "There can be no step back - the land is ours."
alash.780.b: "We need Cossacks out of this."

alash.7800.d: "According to previous negotiations with the Cossack Hosts, their lands were recognized as the property of the Cossacks, therefore the government should not involve into economic matters of the Hosts. However, as local Qazaq populations pledge to return their lands, some of our nationalist-minded ministers suggest that we should deprive the Cossacks of their arable lands as well, resettling it with the Qazaq owner.\n\nThis would, no doubt, signify a 'declaration of war' by the Cossack Atamans."

alash.779.t: "Cossack Uprising!"
alash.779.d: "As expected, the Cossack Atamans were outrageous, when they received information about Cossack lands being requisitioned in favor of Qazaqs, seeing them as a clear threat to their way of life. They have initiated an uprising against our government, promising to answer with sword and rifle, if we dare to confront them. The Alash Militia has already mobilized and is ready to strike back, they only await the order of [ROOT.GetLeader]."

alash.777.d: "Today, [ROOT.GetLeader] has been contacted directly from [FROM.Capital.GetName] with a clear message - they are nothing more, but an autonomous territory, a loyal subject of Russia. At the other end of the wire, they demanded an immediate halt to the unconstitutional land reform. Otherwise, [FROM.Capital.GetName] is threatening to reintroduce troops into the territory of the Autonomy - a privilege they say we \"brazenly took advantage of\" when the metropolis was weak.\n\nAnd it seems like it's now or never. The [ROOT.GetName] must either become free, throwing off the shackles of colonialism, or submit to the Slavic hegemon."

alash.776.t: "Fall of the Autonomy"
alash.776.d: "Of course, Qazaqs had heard of tanks before, but not everyone had seen them. Iron and steel rumbling down dirt streets and cobbled sidewalks. That is the sound of obedience.\n\nThe Great War did not reach the distant steppe, and only the horrors of the 1916 uprising and civil war were still fresh in the memory of many Qazaqs. The uprising failed, bringing only pain and exile. The civil war did not bring the long-awaited freedom. And now again - under the rumble of an armored killing machine - Qazaqs are forced to bend the knee.\n\nNumerous gawkers and citizens who were not lucky enough to be in the proud city of Semey on that ill-fated day, when ministers were led out of the government building in handcuffs by an armed convoy for treason."
alash.776.a: "Russia comes back."

alash.775.d: "The treacherous [ALO.GetName] has been finally taken down. With the Russian troops controlling key cities, transport hubs and railways, their weak state stands no chance. The question, however, arises about the future of their autonomy."

alash.771.t: "Russian Embargo"
alash.771.d: "The Russian were bluffing as always. They have sanctioned our government, ending all trade routs and canceling all mutual programs, introducing ban on export and import from and to our country. They believe that such pressure will force us to succumb, but despite economic hardship, at least our land reform can go through."

Their exodus is marked by hardships and troubles, but at least the [RUS.GetAdjective] government seems to take them back with arms outstretched.

alash.763.d: "As part of our land reform, the fate of the lands traditionally held by the Cossacks has become a serious debate. The reform, which aims to redistribute land to Qazaq communities, has encountered significant resistance from the Cossack hosts, who view these measures as a direct threat to their autonomy. The new law mandates the reassignment of large tracts of fertile land currently owned by Cossack settlers to local Qazaqs. In wealth and established Cossack stanitsas, fierce resistance has emerged, leading to clashes. The government now stands at a critical point - whether to leave the Cossacks alone, freezing the conflict, or deal with them once and for all."

alash.761.t: "Law on Surnames and National Identity"
alash.761.d: "In a move to modernize and unify the national identity, the Ministry of Modernization has proposed a sweeping reform regarding the naming conventions of its citizens. Historically, Qazaqs used only personal names, often supplemented by titles or descriptors that reflected their social status or notable characteristics. For example, Bogenbai was known as Bogenbai batyr due to his status as a warrior, and Bukar was known as Bukar zhyrau because of his renown as a poet. This traditional system, however, is now seen as a vestige of tribalism and an obstacle to creating a cohesive national identity.\n\nThe proposed law aims to abolish the use of ancestral names and introduce formal surnames for all citizens. This change is partly inspired by the practice during the Tsarist era and later, under the Russian Federative Republic, where Qazaqs were assigned Russian-style surnames with endings like -ov, -ev, or -in, derived from the name of their father or grandfather. The Ministry suggests to replace these Russian surnames with distinctly Qazaq ones.\n\nThe reform has sparked a heated debate within the parliament and among the public. Nationalists and conservatives argue that the most authentic way to honor Qazaq heritage is to officially recognize ancestral names as surnames."
alash.761.a: "Adopt new Qazaq surnames."
alash.761.b: "Adopt ancestral names as surnames."
alash.761.c: "No need to change that."

### Party Splits ###
alash.999.t: "Azat"
alash.999.d: "The government's recent policies have caused a big rift within the Alash Party. The left wing, which is closely linked to the Western Department of Alash Orda and led by the Dosmukhamedovs, has officially left the Alash Party. This move has led to the birth of a new political party, the Azat Party.\n\nThe Dosmukhamedovs, who are pretty influential in the Uralsk and Jympity area, have been unhappy with the government's direction for a while now. Their frustration has led to the creation of the Azat Party, which they've said will work closely with the Jas Azamat. Jas Azamat, another offshoot from the Alash Party, split in 1931 and has since been championing social-democratic ideals. While the Azat Party itself is still relatively small and primarily influential in its home regions its alignment with the more established Jas Azamat could potentially amplify its political impact."
alash.999.d2: "Today, the left wing of the Alash party, which is closely linked to the Western Department of Alash Orda and led by Jahansha Dosmuhamedov, has officially left the Alash Party. This move has led to the birth of a new political party, the Azat Party.\n\nThe Dosmukhamedovs, who are pretty influential in the Uralsk and Jympity area, have been unhappy with the party's direction for a while now.

alash.998.t: "People's Party"
alash.998.d: "There has been a significant rift within the Alash Party due to growing concern over its increasingly liberal policies. The nationalist and conservative wing of the party, spearheaded by Sadyq Amanjolov, has formally announced the creation of the People's Party.\n\nSadyq Amanjolov, a prominent figure and leader of the Alash Militia, along with his close associates, have expressed their discontent with the current direction of the Alash Party, arguing that it deviates too far from traditional values and nationalistic principles. This faction's dissatisfaction has culminated in the establishment of the People's Party, which aims to champion conservative and nationalist ideals more rigorously. The new party enjoys strong ties with the leadership of the Alash Militia, a key factor that could significantly influence the political dynamics within Alash Orda. The alignment of the National Party with the armed forces underscores the potential risk of losing the loyalty and support of the military, should the central government fail to address their concerns adequately."
alash.998.a: "They were long just an obstacle to liberal [ROOT.GetName]."

alash.997.t: "Dissolution of the Alash Party"
alash.997.d: "The Alash Party, once the dominant political force in Alash-Orda, has officially disbanded following the decision of the two most influential factions to split. This marks the end of an era.\n\nThe radical wing, led by Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, and the moderate wing, led by Älimhan Yermekov, have decided to split due to irreconcilable differences in policy and vision for the future of the country. These two factions collectively constituted a significant majority within the Alash Party. As a result of their departure, the party structure was inevitably disintegrated.\n\nMirjaqyp Dulatuly's radical faction announced the formation of a new political entity, the Janar Party. This party will continue to advocate for progressive reform and modernization. In contrast, the moderate faction of Älimhan Yermekov established the Republican Party. This party is focused on pragmatic governance, stability, and gradual reforms.[alash_997_azat_status][alash_997_halyq_status]"

alash.996.t: "Executive Office Act"
alash.996.d: "Today, Minister-President Mirjaqyp Dulatuly initiated a number of reforms aimed at expanding the powers of his cabinet. Recognizing the need for strong and coordinated leadership, Dulatuly's measures aim to centralize the decision-making process and reduce bureaucratic inefficiency. His plan is to make the office of Minister-President electable by the general population. That would make the Halyq Kenesi feel almost useless, as it will lose its power to appoint the President.\n\nHowever, the Parliament did not like such measures. [GetAlashName], [GetNationalistName] and, of course, Üsh-Jüz have already expressed their disagreement with such a reform. Opposition parties and some regional leaders fear undermining democratic processes and local autonomy. Accusations of authoritarianism and centralization of power were made against the Dulatuly administration. These parties demand a balance - they are ready to vote for this bill, but fearing the usurpation of Dulatuly's power, they demand the empowerment of regional units."
alash.996.a: "Proceed with the current plan."
alash.996.b: "Agree to concessions."

alash.995.t: "Adoption of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] Constitution"
alash.995.d: "Today, the government of [ROOT.GetName] officially adopted a new constitution after declaring independence from Russia. The Constitution begins with the assertion of the sovereignty of the Qazaq state, emphasizing its status as a state governed by its people. The national flag consists of horizontal stripes of green, red and yellow colors. The green color symbolizes the people's commitment to Islam, red - the blood shed in defense of the country, and yellow - the vast Qazaq steppes and the freedom they represent. In the upper corner of the flag, a crescent moon with a star reflects the nation's Islamic heritage.\n\nThe central place in the governance structure set out in the Constitution is occupied by Halyk Kenesi, the highest governing body elected by the people. This body is responsible for electing the President, who is elected for a four-year term with a two-term limit. The President administers through appointed ministers, who are subject to the approval of the Halyk Kenesi and must report on their work to both the President and the legislature. The Vice President acts as the Deputy President, ensuring continuity and support in management.\n\nThe Constitution establishes the separation of powers, in which the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government are clearly distinguished, providing a system of checks and balances. The judiciary acts independently, guided by the law and judicial rules, and judges are elected by Halyk Kenesi for life. The protection of human rights is the cornerstone of the Constitution, guaranteeing equality, freedom and the right to a happy life for all citizens, regardless of religion, ethnicity or gender.\n\nSpecific provisions relate to the unique aspects of Qazaq society. The Constitution provides that all people have equal rights and prohibits discrimination based on religion, blood, clan or race. The law guarantees freedom of speech, association and the creation of organizations, while prohibiting activities that incite tribal or national strife. Legal guarantees protect citizens from unlawful detention and guarantee the right to privacy.\n\nAs for land, the Constitution proclaims that Qazaq land is the collective property of the people, is not subject to sale, but is managed for the benefit of all. Natural resources, including minerals, forests, waters, lakes and mountains, are State property, and the use of land for grazing, farming and construction is regulated by the Government in the public interest.\n\nOur nation is embarking on a new path, the constitution is evidence of the Qazaq people's desire for a just, free and prosperous state."

The event attracted a wide array of attendees, including party members, political observers, journalists, and citizens eager to learn about the new political force promising transformative change.\n\nThe congress began with an opening session, where the founding members of the Janar party welcomed the delegates and attendees. The hall, adorned with the green, red, and yellow colors of the national flag, buzzed with anticipation as the proceedings commenced. Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, the charismatic leader of the Janar party, took to the stage to present the program charter. Dulatuly, known for his eloquence and passion, delivered a compelling speech that highlighted the core principles and key policies of the Janar. In his keynote speech, Dulatuly emphasized the need for a new political direction in Alash Orda, one that embraces progress and institutional modernization.\n\nThe culmination of the congress was the formal adoption of the Janar’s program charter. Delegates voted overwhelmingly in favor of the charter. In his closing remarks, Dulatuly thanked the delegates for their participation and dedication. He emphasized that the success of the Janar party would depend on the continued engagement and activism of its members and supporters."

The event was a significant milestone for the party, led by the influential political figure Älimhan Yermekov. The congress began with a formal opening ceremony, featuring traditional Qazaq music and a ceremonial flag-raising. The party's banner, same as was used by the Alash party, was prominently displayed. Älimhan Yermekov took center stage to present the Republican Party's vision and policy platform. His speech was characterized by its clarity and conviction, emphasizing the party's commitment to republicanism, democracy, and national sovereignty. The highlight of the congress was the formal adoption of the Republican Party’s platform.

alash.992.d: "In a dramatic and unprecedented move, Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, the Minister-President of Alash Orda and unrivaled leader of the [GetZhanarName] party, has orchestrated a self-coup, seizing power and transforming [ROOT.GetName] into a one-party state under his leadership. The coup began in the early hours of the morning, as loyalists within the military and key government institutions executed a meticulously planned operation to secure strategic locations throughout [ROOT.Capital.GetName]. Communication hubs, government buildings, and major transportation routes were swiftly taken under control, ensuring minimal resistance and preventing any coordinated opposition. Dulatuly, flanked by senior military officials and [GetZhanarName] members, addressed the nation from the steps of the Parliament building. In his speech, he declared the ban of all political parties except for the [GetZhanarName]. He justified his actions by citing the need for strong and decisive leadership to guide [ROOT.GetName] through its ongoing modernization and development challenges.\n\nSupporters of Dulatuly and the [GetZhanarName] party welcomed the move, seeing it as a necessary step to accelerate the nation’s transformation and secure a prosperous future. Opposition Parties and Dissidents condemned the coup as a blatant power grab, an assault on democracy, and a betrayal of [ROOT.GetName]'s founding principles."
alash.992.a: "Last hope for our state."

alash.991.t: "Mirjaqyp Dulatuly Arrested!"
alash.991.d: "Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, the ambitious Minister-President of Alash Orda and leader of the [GetZhanarName], has been arrested following the failure of his attempted coup. The coup attempt began in the early hours of the morning, as Dulatuly’s loyalists within the military and key government institutions moved to secure strategic locations across [ROOT.Capital.GetName]. However, the plot was uncovered by elements within the Alash Militia and opposition factions, who swiftly mobilized to counter the threat. As Dulatuly took to the steps of the Halyq Kenesi building, opposition forces were already moving to thwart his plans. His speech was abruptly cut short as Alash Militia units, surrounded the building and detained the coup plotters. Following the arrest of Dulatuly and his key supporters, the situation in Orenburg and across Alash Orda remains tense. Dulatuly, along with several high-ranking members of the Janar Party and military officers involved in the coup, have been detained and are awaiting trial. The Alash Militia has imposed a temporary state of emergency to restore order and prevent any further attempts at destabilization.\n\nWhile some argue that instead of Dulatuly's coup, it was in fact the Alash Militia, that is now in control, still many hope that eventually Sadyq Amanjolov will restore democracy."
alash.991.a: "So, a coup and counter-coup in one day?"

alash.990.t: "The Last Fight of Qajymuqan"
alash.990.d: "It was a tense [GetMonth] morning in [590.GetName]: the Alash government had officially banned the Üsh-Jüz party. The rivalry with Alash and its representatives lasted for decades - so strong was the hatred between the two. And at the center of this storm was Qajymuqan Munaitpasuly, a prominent member of Üsh-Jüz and a legendary figure among his people.\n\nQajymuqan, a huge man with an imposing appearance, was known not only for his physical strength but also for his unwavering loyalty to the Qazaq people. A former wrestler, he earned respect and admiration not only throughout the steppe, but also throughout the world.\n\nThe government argues that Üsh-Jüz's activities threaten national unity and foment ethnic and religious discord, posing a significant risk to the stability of the newly formed Qazaq state. “Their rhetoric and actions undermine the foundations of our nation,” the interior minister said in a stern address to the Halyk Kenesi. “We cannot allow our country to be divided when we need unity the most.”\n\nQajymuqan, however, viewed the ban as a declaration of war. When government forces began closing Üsh-Jüz regional offices and arresting key leaders of the movement, Qajymuqan stood firm. He called for protests, urging his followers to stand up for their rights, “to overturn Alash as I once overturned Nikolai Turbas.” The situation quickly escalated. Protests erupted in the strongholds of Üsh-Jüz, accompanied by clashes between demonstrators and Alash Militia. In the ensuing chaos, Qajymuqan was arrested.\n\nIn prison, Qajymuqan remained undeterred. His spirit and legacy continue to inspire those who believed in the idea of a unified Qazaq nation-state. However, one would like to believe that this was indeed Qajymuqan Munaitpasuly's last battle, and the last battle with Üsh-Jüz."

alash.989.d: "The two major political factions, [GetZhasAzamatName] and the ruling [GetRulingParty], led by [ROOT.GetLeader], recognized the need for unity in the fledgling republic. This realization led to a series of high-level meetings aimed at forging stronger ties between the [GetZhasAzamatName] and Alash parties.\n\nToday, the leaders of both parties gathered in Halyq Kenesi, to discuss a coalition. Both parties agreed on the need for comprehensive economic reforms to modernize agriculture, develop industry, and improve infrastructure. Furthermore, both parties emphasized the importance of preserving Qazaq culture and heritage. With this agreements, the parties have agreed to form a coalition."
alash.989.a: "[GetZhasAzamatName] and [GetRulingParty] will work together!"

alash.988.t: "The Apolitical Militia"
alash.988.d: "In an effort to strengthen the foundations of democracy in Alash Orda, the Government has initiated important debates to ensure the apolitical status of the Alash armed forces. The move was made in response to growing concerns about military involvement in politics and the need to respect the principle of civilian control over the armed forces. The discussion was provoked by the left-wing factions of the Alash party, who proposed to dismiss Sadyq Amanjolov, the head of the Alash militia and a prominent leader of the conservative faction of the party. They argue that Amanjolov's departure is necessary to prevent any group from using the armed forces as a political tool. The left-wing factions proposed replacing Amanjolov with Bazarbay Mametuly, who is known for his close ties with the radical wing of the party. Although this proposal received the support of the left, it met with considerable resistance from both the conservative faction and moderate members of the Alash party.\n\nConservatives, of course, were against the resignation of their influential leader, considering it as an attempt to weaken their influence. Moderates, on the other hand, expressed reasonable concern about the appointment of Mametuly, pointing out that his close ties with the radical wing would not solve the main problem of the politically influential military. Instead, it may simply shift bias from one faction to another.\n\nIn light of these concerns, an alternative solution was discussed to ensure the neutrality of the armed forces, such as the formation of a Military Council composed of senior military officers of various backgrounds and political views. This council will exercise collective oversight of the armed forces, which will make it difficult for any individual group to exert excessive influence."
alash.988.a: "Appoint Bazarbay Mametuly as the new head of Militia."

alash.987.t: "Ministry of Modernization Seizes Power"
alash.987.d: "Today, the Ministry of Modernization, headed by Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, successfully carried out a coup d'etat, overthrowing Minister-President Älimhan Yermekov and seizing control of the government of [ROOT.GetName]. The seeds of this coup were sown shortly after Älimhan Yermekov assumed the post of Minister-President. Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, having initially persuaded the government to establish the Ministry of Modernization and subsequently assuming the role of its head, began clandestinely conspiring with a select group of loyal ministry employees. Over time, the influence of this group grew, effectively establishing a parallel shadow cabinet that operated in parallel with the official government.\n\nThe increased authority and broad reach of the Ministry of Modernization have allowed Dulatuly and his associates to advance a number of reforms that have strengthened their power and undermined the authority of the Minister-President. These reforms, although ostensibly aimed at further modernization, have also helped to strengthen Dulatuly's control over the most important aspects of the state mechanism.\n\nThe conspiracy has finally come to fruition. Seizing the moment and leveraging their influential supporters within the government and the military, Dulatuly and his faction swiftly and effectively executed a coup d'état. By the end of the day, Älimhan Yermekov was compelled to resign, and Dulatuly was publicly announced as the new head of government. For the general public, the change in government did not elicit any significant concerns.\n\nImmediately following the coup, Dulatuly swiftly implemented measures to consolidate his power. He appointed key supporters to key positions, thereby ensuring the continuation of the reforms of the Ministry of Modernization. In a public address, he called for unity and promised to adhere to the principles of progress and modernization, which have guided his policy so far."

At least that's what “Saryarqa” writes. The newspaper also transmits Yermekov's appeal: \"The Ministry of Modernization, which allegedly strives for progress, has become an instrument of political division. Its activities, which are largely influenced by Dulatuly's corrupt interests, undermined the smooth functioning of our government, and eventually led to a split in the party. The achievements and reforms attributed to the Ministry of Modernization are actually the result of joint initiatives and cooperation between various government departments. It was inefficient and unnecessary to maintain a separate ministry when its functions can and should be performed by other departments.\"\n\nThe article in the newspaper concludes with the words that the ministry's employees, many of whom were loyal to Dulatuly, were transferred to other ministries or dismissed."

alash.760.t: "Addressing the Nomadism Issue"
alash.760.d: "One of the most pressing challenges in Alash Orda is tribalism and nomadism. The central question facing the party is how to balance the traditional nomadic lifestyle, which has defined Qazaq identity for centuries, with the demands of modern statehood and economic development. The left-wing members suggest that first and foremost demand is to redistribute the land. Fertile lands for agriculture and pasture will encourage Qazaqs to settle down on these lands. Furthermore, they believe in a need to promote cooperative farming, which would help them transition smoothly and maintain community bonds. The main part of their plan is a comprehensive support program for the nomadic population - providing free or subsidized housing, education and healthcare.\n\nThe party moderates believe that the issue should be addressed gradually. They have proposed phased programs, that offer housing and employment opportunities over several years.\n\nFinally, the Conservatives have outright denounced any plans on changing the traditional way of life. They see to preserve nomadic way of life, while integrating modern infrastructure and services."

alash.759.d: "Today, the Ministry of Modernization declared a historic victory in its comprehensive sedentarization program, marking the successful transition of the Qazaq people from a predominantly nomadic lifestyle to settled agricultural and urban communities. Under the visionary leadership of Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, the Ministry of Modernization was established to oversee and implement wide-ranging reforms designed to uplift and modernize the Qazaq society. The sedentarization program was a key component of these reforms.\n\nThe success of the program is evident in the statistics released by the Ministry of Modernization. Over 80% of the previously nomadic population has now settled in permanent homes, with significant improvements in living standards, access to education, and healthcare. Agricultural productivity has increased, contributing to food security and economic stability."
alash.759.a: "Great victory!"

alash.758.t: "Tribes Resist Sedentarization"
alash.758.d: "Despite the comprehensive sedentarization program, significant resistance has emerged from some nomadic tribes who view the forced settlement as an attack on their traditional way of life. Several tribes have banded together to resist the government's efforts, leading to violent clashes with Alash Militia forces.\n\nReports indicate that the nomadic uprisings have disrupted transportation routes, destroyed infrastructure projects, and resulted in casualties on both sides."
alash.758.d2: "Despite the comprehensive sedentarization program, significant resistance has emerged from some nomadic tribes who view the forced settlement as an attack on their traditional way of life. In the steppes of [590.GetName], several tribes have banded together to resist the government's efforts.\n\nReports indicate that the nomadic uprisings have disrupted transportation routes and destroyed infrastructure projects, furthermore - the Alash Militia, headed by a known supporter for nomadism, Sadyq Amanjolov, did nothing."
alash.758.a: "That's bad."

alash.757.t: "Resource Shortages in New Settlements"
alash.757.d: "As the sedentarization program progresses, the rapid influx of nomadic populations into newly established settlements has led to severe resource shortages. The infrastructure, still in its nascent stages, is struggling to provide adequate food, water, and shelter for the growing number of settlers.\n\nReports of famine have emerged from several settlements, with food supplies dwindling and agricultural production failing to meet the needs of the population.\n\nThe government's response has been to divert resources from other regions, but this has led to discontent and unrest in those areas as well."
alash.757.a: "Alarming."

alash.756.t: "Corruption Scandal Disrupts Sedentarization"
alash.756.d: "A major corruption scandal revealed widespread embezzlement and mismanagement of funds intended for the sedentarization program. Investigation has uncovered that local administrators have been siphoning off resources meant for building infrastructure and supporting settlers. This scandal has not only delayed the construction of vital facilities but has also eroded public trust in the government's ability to manage the program effectively."

alash.700.d: "With our decision to support the ROVS, a lot of oppositional parties, not only those who call for independence, but also those, who call for revolution, were outraged. The first signs of instability appeared in the north-eastern regions, where the proportion of workers is higher, in the mines of [404.GetName] and industrialized regions, such as [588.GetName]. The remnants of the Qazaq Bolsheviks, led by Alibi Jangildin, started rallying for support and call for socialist revolution in all of [ROOT.GetName]. Not only the workers are joining those calls, but also Dehkans, who are against the dominance of wealthier farmers and smallholders. The organization of Qosshy has also supported the revolution. With the revolutionaries already starting to seize administrative buildings and form so-called 'Soviets', the situation is becoming dare."

With this move, they hope to make some concessions to the revolutionaries and stop their propaganda from spreading. Furthermore, the risk of a civil war will negatively affect our state and bring even more instability."

The Halyq Keńesi was dissolved by Jangildin and the 'Soviet Power' was proclaimed. With our country rapidly descending into our own civil war, it is high time for the Qazaqs to take arms and defend their homeland from those Bolshevist occupiers!"

In Orenburg, a brigand ataman Dutov has gathered his loyalists and armed cossacks in order to finally proclaim their independence. While we are actively engaged in the civil war with Bolsheviks, it seems that we won't be able to fight on two fronts and we have to accept our fate and let the cossacks go."

alash.696.d: "Today, our government received the news of civil war in [ALO.GetName]. The legitimate government is fighting against the Qazaq Bolsheviks, led by Alibi Jangildin, which also leaves their southern borders unsecured. With our claims to the regions of [589.GetName] and [1203.GetName], government suggests that we should annex these territories as soon as possible, framing it as securing these territories from Bolshevist agenda and terror. On the other hand, we can respect sovereignty of our neighbors."

alash.696.b: "Support our [ALO.GetAdjective] brothers instead!"

alash.695.t: "The Red Caravan"
alash.695.d: "The history of the Qazaq Bolsheviks is a story of unwavering dedication, revolutionary fervor, and relentless pursuit of change, personified by the legendary \"Red Caravan\". The seeds of this movement were planted in 1915, when Alibi Jangildin became the first Qazaq Bolshevik, and a year later, together with Amangeldy Imanov, he led an armed uprising against the tsarist government. After the February Revolution, Jangildin set off for Petrograd, where he studied the art of agitation and received from the Bolsheviks the authority to conduct propaganda. Upon his return to [402.Getname], he was eager to spread Bolshevik ideas, but was quickly arrested on the orders of the then regional commissioner of the Provisional Government, Älihan Bökeihan. As the Civil War unfolded against the Reds, and the Alash Orda and the White forces gained the upper hand, Jangildin, undaunted, fled first to Persia and then to the French Commune to seek further support from the Bolsheviks. Years later, he returned to Alash Orda incognito, dedicating himself to rebuilding the underground communist movement with the alleged help of Russian leader Bukharin and his People's Socialist Party.\n\nThis marked the first appearance of the \"Red Caravan\" as a means of agitation and propaganda. Traveling through the auls, and even visiting some factories and mines, the caravan became known for its \"Robin Hood\" actions — protecting the poor from despotic landowners and spreading communist ideology.\n\nThe Alash Orda government, wary of the growing influence of the Red Caravan, issued a wanted notice for its members. Despite their efforts, the caravan remained elusive, becoming a legend among the people and a persistent thorn in the side of the authorities."
alash.695.a: "Who tells such silly stories? They're just a bunch of bandits!"

alash.694.t: "Total Loss of Control of Orenburg!"
alash.694.d: "Soon after we renounced our ties with [RVA.GetName], Orenburg Cossacks began preparing for seceding from our state.

While we are actively engaged in the civil war with Bolsheviks, it seems that we won't be able to fight on two fronts and we have to accept our fate and let the cossacks go."


### Cossack Question ###

alash.605.t: "An Opportunity"
alash.605.d: "Throughout the 1920s, Russian influence over the Alash Orda maintained a balance between the Cossack Hosts and the central administration. The Cossack communities, feeling more aligned with Russia than with the Alash government, operated with significant autonomy, often ignoring Alash authorities. However, with Russia's control waning, the government sees an opportunity to take serious steps to integrate the Cossack Hosts into its administrative and military structures."
alash.605.a: "We must ensure cossacks are under our control."

alash.604.t: "Skirmish in [589.GetName]"
alash.604.d: "A recent skirmish in Semirechye has escalated tensions between the Qazaq communities and the Cossack forces. During an altercation, a Qazaq merchant was killed by a Cossack officer. The incident occurred when Qazaq was accused of stealing the horse from the Cossacks. Witnesses claim that Cossacks acted with excessive force, leading to the merchant's death.\n\nThe merchant's death has sparked outrage among the local Qazaq population, with many demanding justice and accountability for the officer's actions. They also state that Ataman Ionov of the Semirechye Cossacks has something to do with this. The Cossacks, however, argue that their fellow was merely doing his duty in a volatile situation and that his actions were justified given the circumstances."
alash.604.a: "Initiate a deeper investigation"
alash.604.b: "Sentence the Cossack to prison and pay damages."

alash.603.t: "Coup in Uralsk"
alash.603.d: "Rumors have reached our armed forces of a coup d'état being prepared in Uralsk. However, as it turned out, it was not a coup against our state, but internal Cossack strife. It turned out that there was a long-standing feud between Vladimir Tolstov, the ataman of the Ural Host, and one of the Ural Cossacks, Mikhail Borodin. It all started back in 1917, when in Uralsk, at the Extraordinary Congress of Elected Representatives, elections were held for the Ataman of the Ural Cossack Host. Borodin was nominated by a part of the Cossacks for this post and according to the results of voting took the second place, second only to the honored Lieutenant-General Lyubavin. However, the day after the election, the winning candidate Lyubavin refused the post, citing old age and illness. The next candidate was Borodin, but he also refused the post of ataman, which was his fatal mistake. Vladimir Tolstov, a man who, in the opinion of many Ural cossacks, had almost destroyed the Ural Host, became ataman.\n\nBorodin himself held rather liberal views, supporting first the Provisional Government, then the Komuch. Tolstov, on the other hand, was committed to more authoritarian views and supported Kolchak.\n\nNow rumors leaked out that Borodin had colluded with Ataman Dutov, the leader of the Orenburg Cossacks, due to the contradictions between Dutov and Tolstov. This information is very valuable, but we, as unwitting witnesses to what is going on, can play a key role in resolving this intricate situation."
alash.603.a: "Don't interfere - cossack feuds play into the hands."
alash.603.b: "Uncover the conspiracy in exchange for Tolstov's loyalty."

alash.602.t: "Nikolay Shcherbakov Leads the Semirechye Cossacks"
alash.602.d: "In Sergiopol, the new elections of the Semirechye Cossack Ataman have concluded. Despite the government's attempts to influence the elections in order to get a loyal and moderate Ataman, the Cossacks have elected Nikolya Shcherbakov - once a vice-Ataman of the Host during the civil war. A staunch supporter of Russia, Shcherbakov is likely to save the Semirechye Cossacks' course for autonomy and self-sufficiency. However, he lacks Ionov's authority, and without support of the Orenburg and Ural Cossacks, Shcherbakov is single in his struggle.\n\nThe arrest of Ionov facilitated in strengthening control over [589.GetName], as Sergiopol remains the last significant bastion of Cossacks in the region."
alash.602.a: "Interesting."

alash.601.t: "Semirechye Cossacks Leave For Xinjiang"
alash.601.d: "After the rights of the Cossacks were completely curbed, and the major centers of Cossack unrest destroyed in the West of the country, surrounded and weak cossacks of Semirechye under their ataman Shcherbakov have decided to leave [ROOT.GetName] for Xinjiang. Despite ongoing instability in China, perhaps, their final destination is the Russian Far-East or Mongolia, but whether they would be able to make this journey is unknown. With their exile, the history of Semirechye Cossacks seems to be ended."
alash.601.a: "[589.GetName] is restored to Qazaqs!"

alash.600.t: "Law on Nagaykas"
alash.600.d: "In response to increasing violence and unrest involving the Cossacks, the government has adopted a new law regulating the possession and use of nagaykas (traditional Cossack whips). These weapons have become symbols of oppression and brutality in the eyes of many Qazaqs. The law stipulates that possession and use of nagaykas are now illegal without explicit permission from the government. This measure is intended to curb the use of nagaykas in conflicts and to reduce the power of Cossack forces to intimidate and harm local populations. A strict licensing system will be established, requiring individuals to apply for and receive a permit to legally possess and use a nagayka. Severe penalties will be imposed on those found in violation of the law, including fines, confiscation of the nagayka, and potential imprisonment for repeat offenders.\n\nMany Qazaq citizens and local leaders have expressed strong support for the law, viewing it as a necessary step to protect them from Cossack violence and to assert government authority over militarized groups. Cossack leaders and their supporters have criticized the law, arguing that it targets their culture and traditional practices, not to mention that it prevents the efficient use of horses."
alash.600.a: "It's not a horse management tool, but rather an impact weapon!"

alash.599.t: "Negotiating Loyalty"
alash.599.d.intro: "Today, in [1208.GetName], the negotiations are being held between Ataman Dutov of Orenburg Cossack Host, respectively, and the government of [ALO.GetName]. The representatives of the government enter the negotiations with clear objectives in mind. Their primary goal is to solidify the loyalty of the Cossack hosts to the people of [ALO.GetName]. To achieve this, they propose that the Cossacks pledge allegiance to the [ALO.GetName], committing themselves to serve its interests and uphold its laws. Furthermore, the government seeks to integrate the Cossack hosts into the structure of the [ALO.GetName]'s irregular armed forces. In exchange for social privileges and autonomy, the Cossacks would be expected to contribute their military expertise and manpower to bolster the defense and security of the autonomy. The status of the Cossack Hosts should be clarified in law and treaty, and all the duties and rights of both parties would be listed there.\n\n"

alash_599_d_failure: "Dutov, given the conflict between him and Ataman Tolstov of the Ural Cossack Army, was initially inclined to negotiate.

# Coup in Uralsk happened
alash_599_d_medium: "After the coup in Uralsk, relations between the Ural and Orenburg Cossacks improved considerably. Ataman Borodin also attended the meeting as a party. It was noticeable that Dutov and Borodin were more confident and their demands were more serious. The Cossacks refused to swear an oath, any interference in their economic affairs, but agreed to participate as counselors for the [ROOT.GetAdjective] armed forces. Nevertheless, their autonomy became largely untouchable by our government. Whether to accept such conditions, clearly unpopular among the Qazaqs, remains a question."

His liberal Ural Cossack associate, Mikhail Borodin, was also present at the meeting. They agreed to some of the government's demands. In particular, the delimitation of borders and the definition of the rights and obligations of Cossack autonomy through law. In addition, Ataman Dutov demanded a leading role in the general staff of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] armed forces, and rejected all demands for control over the Cossack economy.

alash.598.d: "The negotiations saw the Cossacks firmly refusing to pledge an oath of loyalty to the Alash people and rejecting any governmental interference in their economic affairs. However, they agreed to participate as advisors for the Alash militia, leveraging their extensive military experience. Despite the concessions made by the Cossacks, the Cossacks’ autonomy remained largely untouchable by the Alash Orda government, ensuring that their traditional structures and control over local matters were preserved. This outcome, while not ideal for expanding governmental control, at least diminished the possibility of bloodshed.\n\nWith the agreements signed, only Semirechye Host remains with undefined status, but the government counts on the help of Atamans to persuade Ionov into signing the agreement as well."
alash.598.d2: "The negotiations were a success, as Dutov and Borodin agreed to several of the government's demands. They accepted the delimitation of borders and the formal definition of the rights and obligations of Cossack autonomy through legislative means. However, they adamantly refused any control over Cossack economic affairs, emphasizing the importance of their financial independence. Ataman Dutov demanded a leading role in the general staff of the Alash militia, which the government accepted. This agreement marked a significant step towards stabilizing relations with the Cossacks. By addressing the border issues and formalizing the rights of Cossack autonomy, the government secured a degree of influence while avoiding direct economic interference.\n\nWith the agreements signed, only Semirechye Host remains with undefined status, but the government counts on the help of Atamans to persuade Ionov into signing the agreement as well."

The affected lands, traditionally used by the Cossacks for grazing, are now under the control of a group of Cossacks. This aggressive move has exacerbated already tense relations, but Cossacks have committed similar misconduct in the past.\n\nThe incident began when a group of Cossacks, well armed and organized, broke into the ancestral Qazaq territories early in the morning. They claimed that these lands were historically Cossack territory, ignoring existing agreements and the established rights of the Qazaq community to this territory. Caught by surprise, the herders were forced to retreat, leaving their grazing animals and homes behind.\n\nThe seizure sparked outrage among the local population, who saw it as a blatant encroachment on their ancestral lands. Local leaders called on the Alash-Orda government to take immediate action to redress the injustice and return the pastures."

alash.596.t: "Cossacks Steal Livestock!"
alash.596.d: "In a brazen act of aggression, a band of Cossacks has reportedly stolen livestock from a Qazaq aul, further exacerbating the already tense relations between the two communities. The incident occurred in the early hours of the morning, when Cossack raiders, armed and mounted, entered the pastures of a settlement and drove away a significant portion of the Qazaqs' cattle. Caught by surprise, the herders were unable to defend their property.\n\nEyewitnesses described the raid as well-coordinated and swift. The Cossacks, believed to be from a nearby stanitsa, targeted the aul’s most valuable assets – their cattle and horses – crucial for sustenance. The stolen livestock represent not just an immediate financial loss, but also a threat to the community’s long-term viability. The people demand protection and justice."

In a dramatic turn of events, the Ural and Orenburg Cossacks, led by their respective Atamans Tolstov and Dutov, have declared their independence from the Alash Orda.

Skirmishes erupted in the streets of [406.GetName], with strategic points being fiercely contested. Tolstov, taken by surprise and lacking sufficient loyal support, found his position increasingly precarious. Within a few hours, Borodin's forces overwhelmed Tolstov's loyalists. Tolstov was captured and, to avoid further bloodshed, agreed to step down and leave [406.GetName] under armed escort. Borodin, now in control, moved quickly to consolidate his position. He reached out to our government, requesting recognition of his leadership. In return, he promised to stabilize the region and ensure the Ural Cossacks would support the broader goals of [ALO.GetNameDef].

Security forces were deployed to restore order, and a thorough investigation into the causes of the violence was launched. The investigation revealed that Ataman Aleksandr Ionov had not only failed to mitigate the tensions but had actively inflamed them. Testimonies and documents uncovered by investigators pointed to Ionov’s involvement in spreading rumors and encouraging hostility to solidify his political power. Early this morning, government forces surrounded Ionov’s residence in Sergiopol. Despite a brief standoff with his loyalists, Ionov was taken into custody without significant bloodshed. He has been transported to the capital under heavy guard, where he will face charges of incitement, corruption, and endangering public order.\n\nThe arrest of Ataman Ionov is met with mixed reactions in [589.GetName].

He participated in the uprising of the Astrakhan Cossacks during the Civil War, and then led the Ural Military Government and the Ural Separate Army as part of Kolchak's Army. However, the ataman wanted to “own and rule” himself, did not recognize any leadership, which caused his conflict with Dutov and Kolchak, and did not obey orders, fighting at his own discretion. The Ural Cossacks refused to help the Komuch, the rebellious workers in Izhevsk, did not help the Western Alash-Orda either. This is a treacherous man, but we can play on their conflict with Dutov.\n\nFor our part, we offered Tolstov to deal with Ataman Dutov and General Borodin, who were preparing a conspiracy. In return, Tolstov was obliged to swear an oath of allegiance to Alash-Orda and to receive the right to take the post of military adviser. However, Tolstov asked for something else - [alash_586_d_guryev_check]the right to freely dispose of the economy in the entire Ural Cossack army. This deprives us of the opportunity to return the lost lands to the Cossacks, but by dealing with Dutov, we will significantly weaken Tolstov himself."

alash.585.d: "We pushed the Cossacks head-on. After pointing out to Vladimir Tolstov that a coup was being prepared, he first ordered the arrest of cossack Borodin for treason. With the support of the Alash Militia, the uprising was soon nipped in the bud. Of course, this did not please Ataman Dutov very much. He announced the immediate mobilization of the Cossacks against the traitors of the Urals and the unfaithful Qazaqs.\n\nOrenburg was completely overrun by Dutov's Cossacks, and if we did not do something soon, a real armed uprising would begin."

alash.499.t: "Honoring Akkagaz Doszhanova"
alash.499.d: "Few individuals stand out as brightly as Akkagaz Doszhanova, the first Qazaq woman to become a medical doctor. Born in 1893, Akkagaz's life was marked by remarkable perseverance and dedication to education, enlightenment, and medical science.\n\nRaised by her brother, Sagyndyk Doszhanov, after losing her parents at a young age, Akkagaz learned to read and write early. Her brother, a passionate educator who managed schools in Tomarotkel and Barty volosts near Orenburg, inspired her to pursue knowledge and serve her community. Akkagaz's journey of enlightenment began in the Russian-Qazaq school in Orenburg, where she graduated with honors in 1914. Her academic excellence led her to the Orenburg Women's Gymnasium and subsequently to Moscow, where she pursued medical studies. Akkagaz's relentless pursuit of education and her commitment to the betterment of her people did not go unnoticed. In 1917, she was elected as a deputy to the Qurultai of Muslims in Moscow, where she delivered a significant report on the situation of Muslim women. However, her studies were interrupted, and in 1918, she returned to her homeland.\n\nIn 1922, Akkagaz graduated from the medical faculty of the Turkestan State University in Tashkent, becoming the first Qazaq woman to earn a medical degree. Her return to her homeland marked the beginning of her career as a pioneering doctor and an advocate for women's rights and education. She contributed to the intellectual life of her community through her writings in publications such as \"Abai\" and \"Jas Azamat\".\n\nSadly, Akkagaz's promising career and life were cut short. In 1930, she moved with her family to Verniy, where she began working as Doctor №1 at the city hospital. Despite her significant contributions to medicine and society, she succumbed to complications from an illness and passed away in 1932. Her life serves as an inspiration and a testament to the power of education, resilience, and dedication to public service."

alash.498.t: "Cradleland of Alash"
alash.498.d: "The city of Alash, formerly known as Semipalatinsk, stands as a testament to the visionary efforts of the Qazaq national intelligentsia. The quest to find a political center for the Qazaq steppe predates the declaration of autonomy, with discussions spearheaded by Älihan Bökeihan as early as 1915. The search initially included cities like [590.GetName], [1208.GetName], and Troitsk, but each had its drawbacks — either a limited Qazaq population or an underdeveloped intellectual and cultural environment. Semipalatinsk emerged as the prime candidate due to its rich cultural heritage and established connections with notable figures like Abai, Shakarim, F. Dostoevsky, and G. Potanin. The city's high level of culture, science, and education, combined with its strategic railway links to Russian Siberia and Central Asia, made it an ideal location for the government of the autonomous region.\n\nIn the spring of 1917, the left-bank part of Semipalatinsk, known as Zarechnaya Sloboda, was officially declared the city of Alash by the Alash executive committee. This newly designated city soon became the hub of the Alash Orda government.\n\nAlash-Qala comprised several settlements, including Tinibai, Tarakty, and Jolaman. The Tynybai Mosque, constructed in 1834 by merchant Tynybai Qauqenuly, played a significant role in the community. Nearby was the house of Muhamedhan Seitqulov, a generous philanthropist and imam at the Akhmet Riza mosque, who also sponsored the Alash-Orda's publications, \"Saryarka\" newspaper and \"Abai\" magazine. Seitqulov’s house became a center for intellectual gatherings and later one of the government buildings.\n\nAnother key government building was the residence of merchant Qarajan Uqibayev, who passed away two years ago. Known for his extensive cattle trade, Uqibayev was instrumental in establishing Semipalatinsk's meat processing industry and telephony. His support for the Alash Orda included providing a printing house for their publications.\n\nThe two-storey house of Aleksandr Yerykalov, a second-guild merchant and cattle industrialist, served as the headquarters for the Alash militia. The city's industry thrived, with around 150 factories and workshops by 1936, symbolizing the rapid development and modernization efforts under the Alash government."
alash.498.a: "A great city!"

alash.497.t: "Our Siberian Especially Revered Aqsaqal"
alash.497.d: "A recent historical conference in [810.GetName] brought together distinguished historians to examine the ideological origins and evolution of the Alash movement. The conference placed significant emphasis on the profound influence of Siberian regionalism on the formation of the movement.\n\nThe conference highlighted the pivotal role of Grigory Potanin, a prominent Siberian scholar and public figure whose ideas on regional autonomy had a profound impact on Qazaq intellectuals. Grigory Potanin's legacy was highly valued, particularly in relation to his participation in the First All-Qazaq Congress in Orenburg, where the Alash party was formally established. Potanin, who was fluent in Qazaq, was a respected figure at the congress. In his welcoming speech, Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, one of the organizers, referred to Potanin as \"Our Siberian Especially Revered Aqsaqal\".\n\nUnfortunately, Potanin died in 1920, before the creation of the Alash autonomy. However, Ivan Serebrennikov, Potanin's associate and representative of Siberian regionalists, was present at the conference. Since 1919, Serebrennikov had been engaged in scientific research, working in the statistical and economic department of the Institute for the Study of Siberia in Irkutsk. He posited that Alash-Orda was merely an offshoot of Siberian regionalism. The revolution in Russia rekindled regional aspirations, yet these ideas were more deeply entrenched among the Qazaq elite than among the Siberian intelligentsia. Siberian regionalism ultimately failed, and Alash transitioned from regionalism to national autonomy as a reaction."

alash.496.t: "Assassination of Mustafa Kemal"
alash.496.d: "Yesterday, at 9:05 am, Gazi and Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire Mustafa Kemal Pasha breathed his last breath in a hospital after he was shot dead by an Armenian terrorist during a solemn speech the vizier was scheduled to deliver to a large crowd.\n\nOn receiving such news today, Mirjaqyp Dulatuly was visibly upset. Having based much of his reforms on the deeds and actions of the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, he was now deprived of both a source of inspiration and a wise mentor. It is not known what changes will occur in the Ottoman Empire itself, and whether the reforms of the Grand Vizier will be curtailed, but Mirjaqyp was sure of only one thing - it is necessary to go to the end, and if he is destined to die from the bullet of some bandit-Cossack or Russian colonist, so let this sacrifice will be for the benefit of the great Qazaq people, which deserves to become a great nation, educated and modernized."
alash.496.a: "We have to work days and nights to achieve what Kemal could not!"

alash.495.t: "Maintenance of Public Order"
alash.495.d: "The Ottoman Empire is changing. Recently, Mustafa Kemal, the grand vizier, issued the “Maintenance of Public Order” decree, after a severe crisis in the country. The decree led to the establishment of various tribunals to condemn “enemies of the state” and “in defense of the Ottoman state”.\n\nMirjakip thought for a long time about which way the Empire was turning and where the Grand Vizier's reforms were taking it. Could this be the fate of his people as well? Instead of democracy of the people to the dictatorship and tribunals? No, is this not the true method? But the Empire is weak and will only grow stronger. There was no answer, and the writer's pen was, as if without the writer's knowledge, hammering out letters, then poems, and then just some notes. The night was thickening, and tomorrow would be a new day in the steppe. In a steppe that had already begun to change."
alash.495.a: "That's true pabulum for reflection"

alash.494.t: "The First Alash Aul"
alash.494.d: "The struggle for land and rights in the Qazaq steppes has lasted for decades. For many years, the Qazaqs suffered from the encroachment of settler peasants, who, supported by armed Russian Cossack detachments, seized fertile land and oppressed the local nomadic population. These settlers did not show proper respect for the traditions of the Qazaqs, rejecting their way of life and agricultural practices. As Mirjaqyp Dulatuly reported, the settlers even extorted money from the Qazaqs under threat of violence.\n\nRespected figures such as Japabai Bitibayuly and Bekmukhambet Satypaldyuly became increasingly outraged by these injustices. Bekmukhambet, a mullah with an official mandate from the Tsar, had been friends with Dulatuly since 1904 and often consulted him on various issues. Despite the elders' best efforts, the district chiefs did not respond to their complaints, leaving them powerless against the settlers. In response, Bekmukhambet's group, after secret consultations with Dulatuly's group, decided to take bold and decisive action. They armed their Jigits with clubs, spears and a few rifles and hid them in the thickets. They then summoned the settlers for negotiations, during which they surrounded and captured them. Bekmukhambet confronted the settlers with evidence of their crimes, stating, “Your life has no value. The district chiefs are far away, there are no lawyers nearby either, now we will kill you.” The terrified settlers repented and agreed to negotiate.\n\nAfter this act of resistance, the settlers came to an agreement with the Qazaqs, convinced by Bekmukhambet. His kin accepted 15 tithes of land officially allocated by the Tsarist authorities and settled on the bank of the Sergazy River. Thus was founded the first Alash aul called “Kuanysh” (Joy). This aul, born as a result of resistance and steadfastness, marked the first significant victory of the Qazaq people over the settlers' oppression."
alash.494.a: "A great story, worth of a screen version."

alash.493.t: "The Fragmented State"
alash.493.d: "Despite the official restoration of the Alash Autonomy in 1920, the reality of a unified, unitary state remains elusive. The roots of this division trace back to the Civil War, when insurmountable obstacles necessitated the creation of the Western branch of Alash Orda and the autonomous entity of Oyil Vilayat under the leadership of Jahansha Dosmukhamedov. Jahansha and his namesake Khalel, along with other local figures of the Alash party, came to represent a rather isolated faction within the party, characterized by their left-wing views and regional autonomy.\n\nThe establishment of the Oyil Vilayat effectively bifurcated the Alash Orda into West and East, with an invisible border running along the Orenburg-Tashkent railroad. During the tumultuous times of war, the Oyil Vilayat was granted the right to represent the entire Alash Autonomy in emergencies, which essentially made it an independent state entity.\n\nAfter peace was restored and the Alash Autonomy was formally reestablished in 1920, the Oyil Vilayat was reduced to the status of a regular region, alongside Torğai, Semipalatinsk (Alash), Syrdariya, and Semirechye (Jetisuu) vilayats. However, the divisions persisted.\n\nEconomic and political divides have fueled the growth of federalist sentiments, undermining the formation of a stable Qazaq identity and national unity. The Dosmukhamedovs continue to hold significant influence in the west, while Mirjaqyp Dulatuly maintains control in Torğai. In the east, leadership is split between Älihan Bökeihan and Älimhan Yermekov, while in the south, Sadyq Amanjolov is the most influential. These internal divisions threaten the cohesion of Alash Orda, impeding efforts to solidify a unified national identity."
alash.493.a: "Troubling."

alash.492.t: "The Rise of Pan-Turkism"
alash.492.d: "The Alash movement has long stood on the position of national autonomy, striving to secure a distinct Qazaq identity within the broader framework of the Russian state. The term \"Alash\" itself, evoking the original union of Qazaq tribes and serving as the Qazaq battle cry, underscored this nationalistic ambition. Since the inception of the movement, Alash Orda has been positioned as a national Qazaq autonomy within Russia, shaping all policies and decisions of its leaders. In stark contrast, Turkestan has been the stronghold of Pan-Turkist views. These views permeate nearly all parties and movements within the region, with a strong orientation toward Turkey. Within Alash Orda, only a minority have aligned with the \"pro-Turkish wing\", while the majority, characterized by Älihan Bökeihan as \"westerners\", have looked to Europe and Russia for inspiration and guidance.\n\nHowever, the continued colonial yoke of Russia has exacerbated discontent. Issues such as the settler problem and the economic and political control exerted by Russia have become increasingly untenable. In this climate of growing dissatisfaction, the group within Alash Orda oriented towards Turkey has gained significant traction. This faction has found a charismatic leader in Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, who has been closely watching the policies of the Ottoman Grand Vizier Mustafa Kemal. Dulatuly, inspired by Kemal's vision and reforms, has been vocal about the need for a more radical shift in Alash Orda's direction. He advocates for stronger ties with Turkey and a move towards a Pan-Turkic identity, arguing that this is essential for the survival and prosperity of the Qazaq people."
alash.492.a: "Interesting."

alash.491.t: "First Taxi in Turkestan"
alash.491.d: "In 1912, the residents of [ALO_verniy_kazakh] observed an unusual sight: a car traversing the city's main thoroughfare. This was the first vehicle of [ALO_verniy_kazakh], and it would soon be available for public use. The vehicle's owner, a merchant from Tokmak, a prominent oil producer in the region, was Babakhan Nurmukhammedbayev, an enterprising entrepreneur. Nurmukhammedbayev had grand plans to transform transportation in the region.\n\nInitially, Babakhan's venture into automotive transport began with the goal of establishing intercity cargo-passenger transportation. His first automobile, a “Berliet” from the Moscow assembly plant “Br. Krylovs”, was tested on a route from [ALO_verniy_kazakh] to Kazansko-Bogorodskoye. Babakhan also brought with him the chauffeur. He was a 25-year-old Livonian peasant Johann Reinwald. He not only became Babakhan's personal driver but also a co-owner of a new car company engaged in transporting cargoes and passengers to Kulja and Chuguchak in Western China and Mongolia. This new business required the creation of a material and technical base, construction of fuel and lubricants warehouses, and the training of personnel. Prior to the revolution in [ALO_verniy_kazakh], there were warehouses belonging to \"Nobel Brothers\", an automobile workshop, and chauffeur training courses run by Karp Ovcharov. In 1913, due to financial constraints and logistical challenges, Babakhan sold his car to Johann Reinwald, who continued the business, gradually expanding the fleet with additional vehicles. He also purchased two \"Laurin & Klement\" cars that had been brought to [ALO_verniy_kazakh] by another entrepreneur, Nikolai Surovtsev.\n\nUndeterred by his earlier setbacks, Babakhan decided to re-enter the automotive business in 1920. He reunited with Reinwald and focused on expanding their intercity transportation services. By leveraging their combined expertise and resources, they successfully established a reliable network connecting [ALO_verniy_kazakh], Toqmoq, [586.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_4768], and [584.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Their services became popular for both passenger and cargo transport, significantly boosting regional commerce. Babakhan's vision expanded beyond transportation services. With Reinwald's support, he aimed to create a local automotive manufacturing industry. They acquired licenses and documentation from Berliet and began constructing a manufacturing plant near Verny. By 1926, their plant was operational, producing trucks and cars based on Berliet's designs. The vehicles, known for their durability, quickly gained a reputation for quality."
alash.491.a: "Great we have such men as Nurmukhammedbayev!"

alash.490.t: "The Decline of the Siberian Cossack Host"
alash.490.d: "The Siberian Cossack Host, one of Russia's oldest Cossack armies, has its origins in the December 6, 1582, decree of Tsar Ivan IV the Terrible, who bestowed upon Yermak's squad the designation \"Tsar's Service Host\" in recognition of their role in the capture of the Siberian Khanate. Over the centuries, the Host underwent a process of evolution, with its core rooted in the urban Cossacks of Western Siberia in the 17th century. By 1916, the Host's population had reached approximately 172,000 individuals, with a land ownership of approximately 5 million acres.\n\nThe February Revolution of 1917 further exacerbated class contradictions among the Cossacks. During the First Great Military Circle in Omsk in April 1917, two factions emerged: the \"Old Cossacks\", who sought to preserve their privileges and autonomy, and the \"New Cossacks\", who demanded the elimination of class distinctions. Despite these internal conflicts, the Old Cossacks emerged victorious.\n\nIn 1918, the Host was officially abolished. During the Civil War, Siberian Cossacks aligned with Admiral Kolchak's White forces. Kolchak, recognizing the importance of the \"Cossack oligarchy\", provided Cossack officers with significant promotions and the Cossack communities with financial and material support. However, this support could not contain the rising tensions and factionalism within the Host. Boris Annenkov, the [589.GetName] Butcher, declared himself the military ataman of the Siberian Cossack Host. However, his unilateral proclamation was met with resistance from many Cossacks, leading to open feuds. The infighting and warlordism further fragmented the Host.\n\nAfter the war, the new government of Russia, which was focused on post-war reconstruction, refused to reinstate the Siberian Cossack Host. This decision marked the end of the Host's existence, as the internal divisions and external pressures proved insurmountable."
alash.490.a: "Will such fate follow all other Cossack Hosts?"

alash.489.t: "Ukrainian Diplomatic Mission in [ALO.GetName]"
alash.489.d: "In a significant step towards mutual support among emerging national states, the Ukrainian People's Republic has officially opened its diplomatic mission in [ALO.GetName]. In the north of [ALO.GetName] lies a vibrant Ukrainian community known as “Grey Ukraine” or “Grey Klyn”. This community was established by Ukrainian settlers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Seeking new opportunities and fertile lands, these settlers brought with them a rich cultural heritage, including their language, traditions, and agricultural practices. Over time, Grey Ukraine developed into a significant and influential enclave, now centered around the [590.GetName] Ukrainian Rada, led by Chairman V. Nagirnyi.\n\nFollowing the overthrow of the Hetmanate of Pavlo Skoropadskyi, the new government wished to expand its foreign influence, particularly towards the Ukrainian diaspora in Grey Klyn. The opening ceremony, held in [ALO.Capital.GetName], was attended by prominent figures from both governments. Representatives from the UPR, including their appointed ambassador, along with V. Nagirnyi and Minister-President [ALO.GetLeader], were present. The Ukrainians in Grey Ukraine are now truly a living bridge between the countries, and the representatives hoped that they will work tirelessly to ensure the prosperity of diaspora and the strengthening of bonds between the countries."

alash.489.b: "We hope for fruitful cooperation with the Qazaq colleagues."

alash.488.t: "Ukraine Severs Diplomatic Ties with [ALO.GetName]!"
alash.488.d: "In a dramatic turn of events, [UKR.GetNameDef] has announced the severance of diplomatic ties with [ALO.GetNameDef]. This decision comes in response to the [ALO.GetAdjective] government's controversial policies regarding the requisition of land from Russian and Ukrainian settlers, which have sparked significant unrest and dissatisfaction within the Ukrainian community in Grey Ukraine.\n\n[UKR.GetNameDefCap], having closely monitored the situation, expressed growing concern over the treatment of Ukrainian settlers. Despite efforts to engage in diplomatic dialogue and seek a compromise, the [ALO.GetAdjective] government's steadfast commitment to its land requisition policies left little room for negotiation. The Ukrainian diplomatic mission in [ALO.GetName], was immediately closed. Ukrainian diplomats and their families began preparations to return to Ukraine, while the fate of the Ukrainian settlers remains precarious, as they have nowhere to leave, except for Russia, which makes their situation even more uncertain."
alash.488.a: "The Qazaq lands should be returned to the rightful owners."
alash.488.b: "We should organize fund-raising and contact the Red Cross!"

alash.487.t: "The Return of Qajymuqan"
alash.487.d: "There are rumors about the legendary Qazaq wrestler Qajymuqan, actively spreading in the auls of [ROOT.GetName]. Qajymuqan was once world famous, but now he is known for his active support of the Üsh-Jüz party, and, if the latest gossip is to be believed, he makes a spectacle of it.\n\nThe latest story, which becomes wilder with every retelling, comes from [402.GetName] Vilayat. Allegedly Qajymuqan, with a red flag on his shoulders, like a hero of \"Bolshevik folklore propaganda\", challenged a local supporter of the [alash_487_alash] party and immediately defeated him in a wrestling match. According to rumors, when the dust settled and the unfortunate [alash_487_alash] supporter rose to his feet, Qajymuqan stood at full height and declared that only the Üsh-Jüz party could overthrow the domination of the [alash_487_alash] bais and intellectuals, who, according to him, were indifferent to the fate of ordinary Qazaqs.\n\nThe image of Qajymuqan, already far from young, stepping into the wrestling ring again, evokes both admiration and awe among ordinary Qazaqs. Despite his age and official retirement from active wrestling, he continues to remain in the spotlight, organizing wrestling championships throughout Alash Orda since 1920. His return to the ring, even if only in the colorful imagination of the villagers, sparked a new wave of respect and interest in the Üsh-Jüz Party.\n\nWhether the incident was real or just a fanciful story told around the campfire by young jigits, Qajymuqan's unique personality, combined with his unabashed political statements, made him a folk hero of sorts. The ridiculousness of turning an elderly wrestler into a political champion, red flag and all, only increased his mystique. In the auls, more and more new stories are told each time. According to one version, Qajymuqan defeated a whole group of [alash_487_alash] supporters at once; according to another, he lifted a yurt from the ground to prove his point."
alash.487.a: "That's a terrific anecdote, too bad it's a lie."

alash.486.t: "First Lady of Alash Orda"
alash.486.d: " was born into the family of Alikhan Beyokeikhan, under the name of Zeinep, the revered first minister-president of Alash-Orda and a national hero, and his wife Elena Sevostyanova. Yelizaveta's early years were marked by a strenuous education. From 1918 to the spring of 1920, she attended the Russian women's gymnasium in Alash-Qala, excelled in her studies, and received a recommendation from the Russian government to attend university. There, in the fall of 1920, she began her medical studies at Tomsk University and completed them in 1922.\n\nHer path crossed with that of Smagul Säduaqasov in 1924, a meeting that united two of the most influential families in [GetAdjective] politics. Their marriage symbolized a powerful alliance that combined the Bokeykhan's heritage with Säduaqasov's growing political influence. After her marriage, Yelizaveta continued her academic career in Tashkent. There she graduated from the medical faculty of Turkestan State University in 1927, earning a medical degree and beginning her career as a physician. The family returned to [ROOT.GetName] soon afterwards.\n\nDespite close ties to the Alash party through his father-in-law, Smagul Säduaqasov pursued an independent political path. He founded the Jas Azamat party, positioning it as a supportive yet separate structure within the Parliament. Now, not only as the daughter of the First Minister-President, but also as the wife of the incumbent one, Yelizaveta became an example to many Qazaq women. Her medical background and dedication to public health provide a valuable perspective in her husband's administration, influencing policies and initiatives to improve the well-being of the Qazaqs. She focuses on improving healthcare services across [ROOT.GetName], particularly in rural areas where medical services are scarce. Furthermore, Yelizaveta works to increase female enrollment in schools and universities."

alash.485.t: "The Gold Rush"
alash.485.d: "By the end of the 19th century, [404.GetName] was experiencing a period of intense economic growth, driven by a gold rush that transformed the city into a thriving hub. The city and its surrounding areas saw a significant increase in gold mining operations, with the region being dubbed the "future California of Russia". Between 1894 and 1900, 132 active mines extracted over 200 poods of gold, making it a significant center for the gold industry in the ore-rich regions of Altai. This rush attracted not only local miners but also foreign investors, notably the British, who poured capital into the burgeoning industry.\n\nDespite the wealth generated, the gold rush brought its share of peril and tragedy. In the summer of 1896, an incident at the Menovshchikov and Khotimsky mines resulted in the unfortunate demise of eleven miners. Despite this setback, the allure of gold remained unabated.\n\nWith the establishment of Alash Orda, the gold industry in [404.GetName] entered a new phase. The Alash government recognized the economic potential of the region's gold reserves and sought to maximize the industry's benefits for the nation. However, the majority of [404.GetName]'s gold was transfered to the central government, which in our case, was not in [810.GetName], but [195.GetName]. With the new period of [ROOT.GetAdjective] independence, much of the gold was once again pouring into our own coffers, making our nation wealthier and more stable. The government hopes that the gold mining industry will continue to thrive, bringing much awaited prosperity and possibilities to improve the life of a common Qazaq man."

alash.394.b: "Promise nothing, assure that their status will be maintained"

alash.395.t: "Lavr Kornilov Passed Away!"
alash.395.d: "Lavr Kornilov, the recognized leader of Russia, has passed away, [RVA.Capital.GetName] reports. A native of [404.GetName], many of locals know him and admire. His Asiatic type of appearence also gained him some respect from the Qazaqs. The new leader of [RVA.GetName], [RVA.GetLeader], is not a friend of our autonomy in any way. Perhaps, this is our chance to become free before it's too late."
alash.395.d2: "Lavr Kornilov, the recognized leader of Russia, has passed away, [RVA.Capital.GetName] reports. A native of [404.GetName], many of locals know him and admire. His Asiatic type of appearence also gained him some respect from the Qazaqs.

Perhaps, this is our chance to become free before it's too late."
alash.395.a: "What has Russia ever done for us?"
alash.395.b: "We are together with Russia, but demand clear guarantees of autonomy."

alash.396.t: "End of the Russian Civil War"
alash.396.d: "The Russians have fought against Russians once again. This fight is over, and the resurgent [RUS.GetName] is now recovering from the chaos and turmoil of the civil war. Their new regime is looking hungrily over our lands, and perhaps we will soon become their target once again."
alash.396.a: "When we grew stronger, they grew weaker."

alash.397.t: "Russia Restores Military Control Over Us!"
alash.397.d: "The Russian troops have now crossed the borders without declaration of war. As masters of these lands, they peacefully restored control over the Orenburg-Tashkent railway, their bases and city centers. Our government has not even received any notification from the Russian government on their actions, but it all makes sense: the Russian army has returned, after the chaos of Kerensky's assassination, to restore control over their southern borders."
alash.397.a: "But... we thought we were independent..."

alash.399.t: "Russian Influence Shrinks!"
alash.399.d: "With Russia slowly emerging into chaos, its influence over our country becomes really nominal, if not less. While we are still not ready to declare full independence, as this implies risks of being declared war on, the government suggests to use these terrible times in our own favour."
alash.399.a: "With Russian influence shrinking, we should be ready to strike first."

alash.398.t: "Influence Over Alash Autonomy Shrinks!"
alash.398.d: "With our country shlowly descending into chaos, we had to withdraw some of our troops from Alash Autonomy, meaning that despite they are still our federal subject, we cannot be completely sure they are fully committed to us. The time will tell if they will become fully independent, but at least me must be ready for another stab in the back from untrustworthy Kirgizs!"
alash.398.a: "There's nothing we can do..."

alash.400.t: "Independence At Last!"
alash.400.d: "The majority of our ministers claim that the time has come to throw off the chains of Russian oppression and end the farce of Alash Orda being part of Russia, despite ethnic Russians and Cossacks believe that there will be no Qazaq state without Russian assistance."
alash.400.a: "Declare full independence from Russia."

alash.401.d: "Terrible news!

alash.430.d: "Today, we have been approached by our loyal [FROM.GetAdjective] government with a special request. Their government has decided that it should unite all of Turkestan under their administration.\n\nThere are several options as to what to answer them, given our own ambitions in the region. First, we can give them the green light for the operation by formally refraining from participating. All of Turkestan would fall under their control. However, this plan has a drawback - what if Alash wants to get out of control itself?\nSecondly, we can assist them in their conquest - but we will only give them control of predominantly Kirgiz territories and take the rest of Turkestan for ourselves.\nThe third option is to actually deny their ambitions, but agree to help liberate the peoples of Turkestan from the oppression of their rulers.\nFinally, we can simply deny them their exorbitant ambitions and ask them to just mind their own business."

alash.36.t: "The Ethnic Problem"
alash.36.d: "Our population is divided into several separate communities: Qazaq and Kyrgyz people, the Russians and the Cossacks. However, with the new policy of 'Kazakhization', the new government is hoping to strenghten Qazaq national identity without oppressing the other social groups. However, it is likely that Russians and Cossack won't like it."
alash.36.a: "It is the country of Kazakhs, after all!"

alash.41.t: "United Muftiate of [ROOT.GetNameDef]"
alash.41.d: "Since the Second All-Qazaq Congress in 1918, we tried to establish an independent Muftiate of muslim Kazakhs. However, with our country being officially secular and being a Russian dependency, the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly has been the supreme clerical institute in our country. The question that arises is whether we should cut our ties with Orenburg Assembly, that is a clearly institute of Russian colonialism, or better not provoke the Russians."
alash.41.a: "The less influence Russia has on us - the better."
alash.41.b: "Orenburg Assembly is not a problem really."

alash.42.t: "Shura-i-Islam"
alash.42.d: "Shura-i-Islam is 'Islam Council' in Arabian. It is a political and social movement in Turkestan and Alash Orda which is closely connected to a national-democratic cultural-enlightenment movement of Jadidism.\nJadidism is an ideology of Islamic modernisation, that the muslim populations of former Russian Empire can adopt norms and principles of liberal democracy. The Shura-i-Islam has contributed much towards educating the Qazaq people, many schools have been opened on their initiative. We must have one of Shura-i-Islam members in our government and continue to modernise Kazakstan."
alash.42.a: "Towards the Future!"

alash.48.t: "Adopting the New Alphabet?"
alash.48.d: "The Qazaq alphabet is based on Arabic script, called 'Jana emle', - created by Baytursynuly in 1912 and officially adopted in 1924. However, numerous politicans have suggested their own variants and even included them in their programmes.\n\nThe idea, shared by the pro-Russian political cliques is to adopt a Cyrillic alphabet in order to have a better communication with the Russians - and also it will make life for the Russian settlers and Cossacks easier, who already developed some king of Russian transliteration. The nationalist clique, however, is strongly opposed to this and claims that we should find inspiration in Ottoman Empire's reform and, as much of the Muslim World, adopt the Latin alphabet. The last, but not the least group thinks that staying with the traditional Arabic script is much prefered and shows our true sovereignty and independence from any foreign opinion."
alash.48.a: "Adopt the Cyrillic - for better mutual understanding with the Russians."
alash.48.b: "Adopt the Latin - we must modernize, not be colonized."

alash.20.b: "We shall fight on the side of the Kazakhs."
alash.20.c: "We have no interests in Central Asia."
alash.20.e: "The Kazakhs are too weak: Russia shall take over their lands."

alash.21.t: "Aid from Russia!"
alash.21.d: "The Russians have sent troops and volunteers to help us in the fight against Turkestan!"
alash.21.a: "Great!"

alash.22.t: "The Submission of the Kazakhs"
alash.22.d: "The Kazakhs are in danger of being eliminated by the forces of Turkestan. They have come to the conclusion that only by being incorporated into Russia will they be able to live in peace and freedom. If we accept them, we will be fighting Turkestan ourselves..."
alash.22.a: "We shall welcome the Kazakhs and defend their rights."
alash.22.b: "We cannot risk such entanglements."

alash.23.t: "War in Central Asia"
alash.23.d: "The recent outbreak of hostilities in Central Asia is worrying to say the least, and brings great destabilisation to our frontiers. The Kazakhs have recently proclaimed that they shall fight on their own against Turkestan, but it seems that they are too weak to survive for very long. This is an opportunity we could use to extend our influence into traditionally Russian lands..."
alash.23.a: "We have no interests in Central Asia."
alash.23.b: "Should Turkestan come near our borders, we shall fight them."
alash.23.c: "The Kazakhs are too weak: Russia shall take over their lands."
alash.23.e: "Only Russian armies can bring order to Central Asia!"

alash.27.t: "More Than An Autonomy"
alash.27.d: "At long last, we are totally free from foreign control. It is time to drop the word 'autonomy' all together and become the 'Orda' envisioned decades ago."
alash.27.a: "Hurrah!"

alash.29.t: "Revolution in Russia"
alash.29.d: "The Russian Republic has fallen into chaos followed by socialist revolution. Our government believes that socialist sympathies will only strengthen in Alash Orda now. We might leave it as it is, or invite cossacks to secure our internal situation."
alash.29.a: "Leave it as it is."
alash.29.b: "Enlarge the powers vested in the Cossack Host."

alash.30.t: "Socialist Riot in Almatu"
alash.30.d: "Latest reports from Almatu say that a large crowd of socialists is sieging administrative buildings demanding the government to give power to the Soviets. Ataman Dutov with his cossacks has arrived in Almatu the next day and tried to restore order in the city. Eventually..."
alash.30.a: "The Revolutionaries declare soviet power across Kazakstan!"
alash.30.c: "Bökeihan has managed to secure his rule with the help of cossacks!"
alash.30.b: "Ataman Dutov restores order and proclaims himself dictator!"

alash.31.t: "Reconciliation with Soviet Russia?"
alash.31.d: "With the successful revolution in Kazakstan, we must install close ties with our closest ally - Russia."
alash.31.a: "Send them a non-aggression treaty."
alash.31.b: "We are on our own."

alash.32.t: "Reconciliation with Don-Kuban and Transamur?"
alash.32.d: "Once, about 20 years ago, Ataman Dutov was the first to recognize Kolchak as the Supreme Ruler of Russia. He still believe in Kolchak's ability to stabilize Russia. With this in mind, many within the government think we should reach out to Transamur and the Cossacks of west and sign non-aggression treaties, to advance our ties. The question remains, shall we?"
alash.32.a: "Send them treaties."
alash.32.b: "We are on our own."

alash.33.t: "A request from [ALO.GetName]"
alash.33.d: "A recently installed government in [ALO.GetName] has sent us a telegram about installing closer economic ties and becoming allied with each other. How should we respond?"
alash.33.a: "Sign the treaty."
alash.33.b: "We shall conquer this land, not ally it!"

alash.34.t.agree: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed"
alash.34.t.disagree: "[FROM.GetName] Refused"
alash.34.d: "The government of [From.GetName] has officially sent us a response about our treaty."
alash.34.a: "A toast to our new friends!"
alash.34.b: "Unfortunate..."

alash.35.t: "Independence for Alash Autonomy?"
alash.35.d: "The main issue, discussed at the Third All-Qazaq Congress was if Alash Autonomy should finally declare independence from Russia. While half of the ministers and senators claim that the time has come to throw off the chains of Russian oppression and end the farce of Alash Orda being part of Russia, the other half, however, consisting mostly of ethnic Russians and Cossacks, believe that there will be no Kazakstan without Russian assistance."
alash.35.a: "No, we must remain loyal to Russia."
alash.35.b: "Declare full independence from Russia."

alash.43.t: "On the other side of Syr Darya"
alash.43.d: "On the opposite bank of the river Syr Darya lies the Islamic Federation of Turkestan - a reactionary and militarized country which shares common origins and culture with us. Though it's unlikely we can persuade the Khan of Turkestan to unite with us into a single federation of Central Asian peoples, there is only one way left to liberate Turkestani people."
alash.43.a: "We are not ready for war..."
alash.43.b: "Liberate the Turkestani peoples!"

alash.44.t: "Central Asian Federation"
alash.44.d: "The peoples of Turkestan have finally liberated themselves from reactionary rule of Mohammed Alim Khan. We should unie with them for the best future's sake."
alash.44.a: "Send our offer to [UZB.GetNameDef]."

alash.45.t: "An Offer From Alash Orda"
alash.45.d: "The government of Alash Orda has sent us an offer to create united Central Asian Federation. While this decision will benefit both of our countries, we are risking to lose our sovereignty."
alash.45.a: "Agree to the proposal."
alash.45.b: "Our independence is sacred!"

alash.46.t: "[UZB.GetNameDef] Accepted the Offer"
alash.46.d: "The government of Turkestan has accepted our offer!"
alash.46.a: "Form the Central Asian Federation!"

alash.47.t: "[UZB.GetNameDef Declined the Offer"
alash.47.d: "The government of Turkestan has declined our offer to unite. What shall we do?"
alash.47.a: "Back down."
alash.47.b: "Then we will force them to join us!"

alash.49.t: "Orenburg Cossack Host"
alash.49.d: "While Orenburg is not located in Alash Autonomy, the Ataman of Orenburg Cossacks, Dutov, is a close friend of Vasily Balabanov. He was one of the first political leaders in Russia to recognize our state and now his Cossack troops are disposed in Alash, securing our state. However, he did not recognize the leadership of Kerensky after the Civil War. The Qazaq army almost entirely depends on Cossacks and the assistance of Ataman Dutov is vital for our state. We should think of granting Cossack special status in Alash Orda, the one that will be much higher than of a regular Qazaq."
alash.49.a: "Grant Special Status to Cossacks"

alash.57.t: "Union with [DKB.GetName]?"
alash.57.d: "The social class of cossacks, though always having special privelege from the Russian government, has been separated and humbled into the dust by the failed republican Russian government. We shall unite our armies with the Don-Kuban cossack to save Holy Russia from the tyranny of socialists and liberals."
alash.57.a: "United we are stronger."

alash.58.t: "Union with [ALO.GetName]?"
alash.58.d: "The government of Ataman Dutov has offered us to unite our armies and government in our struggle against Russia."
alash.58.b: "We won't be absorbed by this crazy ataman!"

alash.59.t: "Treaty of Almatu"
alash.59.d: "We have an offer to the Far-Eastern government: we shall mutually guarantee our countries' existence and unite our forces if Russia will try to declare war on us. The alliance should be created between two our nations."

alash.60.t: "An Offer from Ataman Dutov"
alash.60.d: "The government of Ataman Dutov has offered us an alliance against Petrograd regime."
alash.60.b: "Why should we die for this crazy Ataman?"
alash.60.c: "Orenburg Military District should be created."

alash.61.t: "Cossacks Overthrow Our Government!"
alash.61.d: "Our policy towards cossacks has angered their community in our country. Today, several armed cossack garrisons entered the capital city, led by Ataman Dutov. After a short battle with the local police force, he arrested the government and proclaimed himself dictator of the nation."
alash.61.a: "Long live Ataman Dutov!"

alash.62.t: "Offer From Vladivostok"
alash.62.d: "Kolchak suggested that we should become a 'Military District', recognizing Vladivostok's full authority over us."
alash.62.a: "Sure."
alash.62.b: "We disagree."

alash.63.t: "Dutov Refused!"
alash.63.d: "This freedom-loving crazy Cossack refused to become our puppet. Well, now we should decide if we should mutually guarantee each other or forget about this pointless alliance."

alash.64.t: "[FROM.GetName] Protests Kazakhization"
alash.64.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has decisevely protested against Kazakhization, especially in Kyrgyz and Uzbek minorities areas in several our regions, most notably in [589.GetName]. We can refuse politely or outright say that we will do anything we want on our territories."
alash.64.a: "Kazakhization will stay as it is."
alash.64.b: "Fine, let the Kyrgyz stay away from it."

alash.65.t: "[FROM.GetName] Ends Kazakhization in [589.GetName]"
alash.65.d: "The Alash government has decided to end Kazakhization in regions with significant Kyrgyz minority because of friendly relations between our countries."
alash.65.a: "Nice"

alash.66.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused to Stop Kazakhization!"
alash.66.d: "The traitorous Alash government refused to end Kazakhization in regions with significant Kyrgyz minority, greatly damaging our relations."
alash.66.a: "Try to seize [589.GetName]"
alash.66.b: "We are too weak now to answer them."

alash.100.t: "Join [SOV.GetNameDefCap]?"
alash.100.d: "The recent victories of socialists in Russian and Kazakstan have shown close ties between our countries. The new government of Kazakstan believes that we should join [SOV.GetName] in our common struggle against imperalists and capitalists."
alash.100.a: "Join the Big Brother"

alash.200.t: "[FROM.GetName] Claims Our Territories"
alash.200.d.puppet: "The government of [FROM.GetName] has claimed some of the bordering territories, which has a significant minority of Qazaqs. We can meet our Qazaq friends halfway and separate these territories from our country, effectively transferring the regions under the control of the [FROM.GetAdjective] government. On the other hand, we can maintain these regions under our formal control and increase Qazaq autonomy in these territories, allowing national-cultural autonomy in some way. Nevertheless, we can always just outright deny their request."
alash.200.d: "The government of [FROM.GetName] has claimed some of the bordering territories, which has a significant minority of Qazaqs. Despite the fact that the Qazaqs have decided to declare their independence, we can try to find advantages in their offer and bring them back under our control. Firstly, we can exchange these territories in response to the conclusion of a contract for the supply of a large percentage of their harvest on preferential terms. Secondly, we can directly offer them to rejoin Russia on the rights of broad autonomy, and then the issue of land transfer will be only a formality."
alash.200.a: "Let them have it for free."
alash.200.b: "Create a national-cultural autonomy in these regions."
alash.200.c: "We must have a proportion of their harvest instead."
alash.200.e: "Only if they once again become our autonomy."
alash.200.f: "Just deny their request."

alash.201.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
alash.201.d: "To our great surprise, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to hand over the territories we claimed. This is a great victory for our nation!"
alash.201.a: "Splendid!"

alash.202.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Offer"
alash.202.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to fully transfer these territories, but instead they offered to create a wide national-cultural autonomy in the territories we claimed."
alash.202.a: "That's not what we truly wanted."
alash.202.b: "Alright."

alash.203.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed for Autonomy"
alash.203.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government agreed on terms that we will create a wide national-cultural autonomy in Urda and 'North Kazakstan' regions."
alash.203.a: "Let's do this then."

alash.204.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Demands"
alash.204.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to fully transfer these territories unless we sign an economic treaty, that will grant the [FROM.GetAdjective]s almost half of our yield. While this will put us under certain level of dependency on [FROM.GetName], at least we will have our ethnic territories."
alash.204.a: "Sure..."
alash.204.b: "That's nonsense!"

alash.205.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
alash.205.d: "To our great surprise, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to sign the treaty. Now they are again under our dependence, even if they not fully undestand these. Let them have these territories."
alash.205.a: "Great!"

alash.206.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
alash.206.d: "Unfortunately, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused our terms. That means that they won't have their lands as well."
alash.206.a: "We will get them later."

alash.207.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Our Submission In Exchange!"
alash.207.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to return our territories only if we once again become their autonomy. Even if this will piss off literally every citizen, we will receive protection and territories."
alash.207.a: "We will never become their puppet again!"
alash.207.b: "If this is the price..."

alash.208.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
alash.208.d: "To our great surprise, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to once again become our puppet."
alash.208.a: "Nice"

alash.209.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
alash.209.d: "Unfortunately, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused our terms. This means that they won't become our puppet, but they won't have their lands as well."
alash.209.a: "We will get them later."

alash.210.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
alash.210.d: "Unfortunately, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to hand over our territory."
alash.210.a: "That's bad."

alash.211.t: "Our Influence Over Alash Increased"
alash.211.d: "Our influence over [ALO.GetName] due to the Treaty of Kostanai has increased a lot, with Alash becoming heavily dependent on our country. Without any doubt, this is a great news for us."
alash.211.a: "Nice."

alash.212.t: "Russian Influence Increased"
alash.212.d: "Russian influence over our country due to the Treaty of Kostanai has increased a lot, with us becoming heavily dependent on the Russians. It seems that now nothing can stop Russia from thoroughly integrating us into their country!"
alash.212.a: "Embarassing!"

alash.220.t: "Elections to the Russian Parliament"
alash.220.d: "Since the Alash Autonomy is part of a Federation with Russia, we have representation in the Russian Parliament.\n\nIn connection with the early elections to the Russian Parliament, elections are also being held on the territory of Alash. Several political forces are participating in the elections, including the Dehkan "Qosshy Union", the Alash party and the Orenburg Cossacks, who nominated from the Orenburg province. The Social-Democratic branch of the Alash party put forward a separate list."
alash.220.b: "Social Democratic Alash wins"
alash.220.c: "Alash secures majority"

alash.300.t: "Third All-Qazaq Congress"
alash.300.d: "The Russian Republic is in chaos,society is radicalizing and the economy is falling. Älihan Bökeihan has announced that the Third All-Qazaq Congress should be held immediately in order to solve some up to date issues. On the one hand, Älihan is hoping to finally break away from Russia and secure Qazaq independence. But on the other hand, cutting ties with Russia can lead to serious problems, both political and economical. Moreover, being almost 70 years old, Bökeihan is thinking of retirement and quiet rest somewhere near the Balkash lake. There are also talks about the retirement of the old leader in the government, especially amongs the Young Alash wing of the party. But the instability, which can be caused by retirement can play a joke on us and let the most radical factions seize the power."
alash.300.a: "We must choose wisely."

alash.301.t: "Society Radicalized"
alash.301.d: "The decision of Bökeihan to remain loyal to Russia has provoked a massive unrest among the delegates. Moreover, the socialist party of QTKP is looking forward to use the instability to seize the power and the Orenburg Cossacks, led by Dutov, are ready to establish a firm hand rule if needed."
alash.301.a: "We should deal with unrest!"

alash.302.t: "The Delegates Demand Resignation Of Bökeihan"
alash.302.d: "The Delegates believe that Bökeihan is too old to handle the power in his hands. His decision to remain loyal to Russia has been a devastating choice and perhaps the worst way to end the career. Everything depends on Bökeihan now."
alash.302.a: "Bökeihan retires."
alash.302.b: "Bökeihan refuses to retire."

alash.303.t: "Resignation of Bökeihan"
alash.303.d: "Bökeihan has delivered a speech on the Congress - the one that will be known as his last speech as a politician. He has announced his resignation after serving Alash Autonomy for 19 years as a Minister-President. The snap elections will be held soon. "
alash.303.a: "Perhaps it will solve the political crisis."

alash.304.t: "Qazaq National Elections"
alash.304.d: "The snap elections were held and the winner is..."
alash.304.a: "Social-Democrat wing of the Alash party."
alash.304.b: "Bökeihan's successor secures Alash majority."
alash.304.c: "The Alash democrats choose Tynyshbayuly to lead."

alash.305.t: "Resignation?"
alash.305.d: "Bökeihan is rather old and some people in the government thinks that he can barely hold the nation together. Perhaps it is time for him to retire?"
alash.305.a: "The time has come"
alash.305.b: "Oh come now, old age just means wisdom!"

alash.306.t: "The Resignation of Bökeihan"
alash.306.d: "Following calls for him to step down, Bökeihan has formally resgined from his post. To replace him, snap elections have been called to fill his place as soon as possible."
alash.306.a: "A long time coming..."

On the left flank, the §mAlash§! party is represented by a group of politicians who did not leave the party after the formation of Jas Azamat, united under the leadership of §OJahansha Dosmukhamedov§!. They are quite radical in their policy, intending to reform the party from within and drastically change inequality.\nThe progressive wing of the party is represented by §lMirjaqyp Dulatuly§!, a close associate of Bökeihan, who was predicted to be his successor, but his radicalism and strong personal power base alienated the more moderate Alash members, who preferred the more pragmatic §mÄlimhan Yermekov§!.\nThe moderate centrists are represented precisely by him, who has secured the support of the Alash Party establishment, and who serves as the \"voice of Reason\" of the party. Politicians who want to preserve the status quo and are afraid of rocking the boat are united around him.\nFinally, opposed on the right is §cSadyq Amanjolov§! - the creator of the People's Militia of the Alash Orda, a military leader and defender of the Qazaq people, a nationalist who advocates the development of the army and finally the separation from Russia, prophesied by the Central Asian uprising of 1916.\n\nCurrent §mAlash§!

ALO_relations_with_russia_desc: "With us being the federal autonomy of Russia, which makes us a constituent entity of the Russian Federative Republic, the relations between our countries have worsened over the years. The situation was aggravated by the growing number of Russian settlers, who don't want to assimilate and act like masters on their land. There are certain movement and organizations that want to prevent intensified Russification and Colonisation of our lands.\n\nHowever, we are weak. In order to resist the giant, we should modernize our army and make our economy less dependant on [RUS.Capital.GetName].\n\nBut as the moderates believe, there can still be a diplomatic solution. Should the right government be in power in Russia, perhaps, there's a chance to withdraw from Federative Treaty, taking advantage of this for both sides."
